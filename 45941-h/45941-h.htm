<p>The incidents of the <i>Mantle and the Knife</i> have not, that I can

<p>As for the trial of the <i>Horne</i>, it is not peculiar to our poet: it
occurs in the old romance, intitled <i>Morte Arthur</i>, which was
translated out of French in the time of K. Edw. IV., and first
printed anno 1484. From that romance Ariosto is thought to
have borrowed his tale of the <i>Enchanted Cup</i>, c. 42, &amp;c. See Mr.
Warton's <i>Observations on the Faerie Queen</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The story of the <i>Horn</i> in <i>Morte Arthur</i> varies a good deal from
this of our poet, as the reader will judge from the following
extract:&mdash;"By the way they met with a knight that was sent from
Morgan la Faye to king Arthur, and this knight had a fair horne
all garnished with gold, and the horne had such a virtue, that there
might no ladye or gentlewoman drinke of that horne, but if she
were true to her husband: and if shee were false she should spill
all the drinke, and if shee were true unto her lorde, shee might
drink peaceably: and because of queene Guenever and in despite
of Sir Launcelot du Lake, this horne was sent unto king Arthur."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
This horn is intercepted and brought unto another king named
Marke, who is not a whit more fortunate than the British hero, for
he makes "his qeene drinke thereof and an hundred ladies moe,
and there were but foure ladies of all those that drank cleane,"
of which number the said queen proves not to be one (book ii.
chap. 22, ed. 1632).</p>

<p>In other respects the two stories are so different, that we have
just reason to suppose this ballad was written before that romance
was translated into English.</p>

<p>As for queen Guenever, she is here represented no otherwise
than in the old histories and romances. Holinshed observes,
that "she was evil reported of, as noted of incontinence and
breach of faith to hir husband" (vol. i. p. 93).</p>

<p>Such readers, as have no relish for pure antiquity, will find
a more modern copy of this ballad at the end of the volume.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[For Percy's further notes on this ballad see the modernized
version (book iii. No. 18). Professor Child prints the ballad in
his <i>English and Scottish Ballads</i> (vol. i. p. 1) with a full notice of
the various forms of the story by way of introduction. He
writes:&mdash;"No incident is more common in romantic fiction than
the employment of some magical contrivance as a test of conjugal
fidelity, or of constancy in love. In some romances of the Round
Table, and tales founded upon them, this experiment is performed
by means either of an enchanted horn, of such properties that no
dishonoured husband or unfaithful wife can drink from it without
spilling, or of a mantle which will fit none but chaste women.
The earliest known instances of the use of these ordeals are
afforded by the <i>Lai du Corn</i>, by Robert Bikez, a French minstrel
of the twelfth or thirteenth century, and the <i>Fabliau du Mantel</i>
<i>Mautaill&eacute;</i>, which, in the opinion of a competent critic, dates from
the second half of the thirteenth century, and is only the older lay
worked up into a new shape (Wolf, <i>Ueber die Lais</i>, 327, sq., 342, sq.).
We are not to suppose, however, that either of these pieces presents
us with the primitive form of this humorous invention. Robert
Bikez tells us that he learned his story from an abbot, and that
'noble ecclesiast' stood but one further back in a line of tradition
which curiosity will never follow to its source."</p>

<p>Here follows a list of "the most remarkable cases of the use of
these and similar talismans in imaginative literature." To these
may be added the garland described in the curious old story of
the <i>Wright's Wife</i>, which has been printed since the publication of
Mr. Child's work.</p></div>

THE MARRIAGE OF SIR GAWAINE</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i013.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">Is</span> chiefly taken from the fragment of an old ballad in the
Editor's MS., which he has reason to believe more
ancient than the time of <i>Chaucer</i>, and what furnished
that bard with his <i>Wife of Bath's Tale</i>. The original
was so extremely mutilated, half of every leaf being torn away,
that without large supplements, &amp;c. it was deemed improper for
this collection: these it has therefore received, such as they are.
They are not here particularly pointed out, because the <i>Fragment</i>
itself will now be found printed at the end of this volume.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Sir Frederic Madden supposed this ballad to be founded upon
the <i>Weddynge of Syr Gawen and Dame Ragnell</i>, which he printed
from the Rawlinson MS. c. 86, fol. 128 b, in his <i>Syr Gawaine</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Hales writes as follows respecting the various forms in which
the story appears in literature. "The wonderful 'metamorphosis'
on which this story turns is narrated in Gower's <i>Confessio Amantis</i>,
as the story of Florent and the King of Sicily's Daughter, taken by
him, as Tyrwhitt conjectures, from the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, or some
such collection. It appears again, as the reader will remember, in
Chaucer's <i>Wyf of Bathes Tale</i>. 'Worked over,' says Prof. Child,
'by some ballad-monger of the sixteenth century, and of course
reduced to ditch-water, this tale has found its way into the <i>Crown</i>
<i>Garland of Golden Roses</i>, part i. p. 68 (<i>Percy Society</i>, vol. vi.), 'Of
a Knight and a Faire Virgin.' On a similar transformation depends
the story of 'King Henrie' in Scott's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, edited from
Mrs. Brown's MS., with corrections from a recited fragment, and
modernized as 'Courteous King Jamie' in Lewis's <i>Tales of Wonder</i>.
'The prime original,' says Scott, 'is to be found in an Icelandic
Saga.'"<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Child prints (<i>English and Scottish Ballads</i>, vol. viii. p. 139)
two versions of a Scotch ballad entitled <i>Kempy Kaye</i>, which he
supposes to be an extravagant parody of <i>The Marriage of Sir</i>
<i>Gawaine</i>.]</p></div>

KING RYENCE'S CHALLENGE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i024.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> song is more modern than many of those which
follow it, but is placed here for the sake of the subject.
It was sung before queene Elizabeth at the grand entertainment
at Kenelworth-castle in 1575, and was probably
composed for that occasion. In a letter describing those
festivities, it is thus mentioned: "A Minstral came forth with a
sollem song, warranted for story out of K. Arthur's acts, whereof
I gat a copy, and is this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So it fell out on a Pentecost, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>After the song the narrative proceeds: "At this the Minstrell
made a pause and a curtezy for Primus Passus. More of the song
is thear, but I gatt it not."</p>

<p>The story in Morte Arthur, whence it is taken, runs as follows:
"Came a messenger hastely from king Ryence of North-Wales,&mdash;saying,
that king Ryence had discomfited and overcomen eleaven
kings, and everiche of them did him homage, and that was this:
they gave him their beards cleane flayne off.&mdash;wherefore the messenger
came for king Arthur's beard, for king Ryence had purfeled
a mantell with kings beards, and there lacked for one a place of
the mantell, wherefore he sent for his beard, or else he would enter
into his lands, and brenn and slay, and never leave till he have
thy head and thy beard. Well, said king Arthur, thou hast said
thy message, which is the most villainous and lewdest message that
ever man heard sent to a king. Also thou mayest see my beard is
full young yet for to make a purfell of, but tell thou the king that&mdash;or
it be long he shall do to me homage on both his knees, or
else he shall leese his head." [B. i. c. 24. See also the same
Romance, b. i. c. 92.]</p>

<p>The thought seems to be originally taken from Jeff. Monmouth's
<i>Hist.</i> b. x. c. 3. which is alluded to by Drayton in his <i>Poly-Olb.</i>
<i>Song.</i> 4 and by Spenser in <i>Faer. Qu.</i> 6. 1. 13. 15. See the Observations
on Spenser, vol. ii. p. 223.</p>

<p>The following text is composed of the best readings selected
from three different copies. The first in Enderbie's <i>Cambria</i>
<i>Triumphans</i>, p. 197. The second in the Letter abovementioned.
And the third inserted in MS. in a copy of <i>Morte Arthur</i>, 1632, in
the Bodleian Library.</p>

<p>Stow tells us, that king Arthur kept his round table at "diverse
places, but especially at Carlion, Winchester, and Camalet in
Somersetshire." This <i>Camalet</i>, sometimes a famous towne or
castle, is situate on a very high tor or hill, &amp;c. (See an exact
description in Stowe's <i>Annals</i>, ed. 1631, p. 55.)</p>

KING ARTHUR'S DEATH.</h3>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Fragment.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i027.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this ballad is evidently taken from the old
romance <i>Morte Arthur</i>, but with some variations, especially
in the concluding stanzas; in which the author
seems rather to follow the traditions of the old Welsh
Bards, who believed that King Arthur was not dead, "but conveied
awaie by the Fairies into some pleasant place, where he should
remaine for a time, and then returne againe and reign in as great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>authority as ever." Holinshed, b. 5, c. 14, or as it is expressed in
an old Chronicle printed at Antwerp 1493, by Ger. de Leew,
"The Bretons supposen, that he [K. Arthur]&mdash;shall come yet and
conquere all Bretaigne, for certes this is the prophicye of Merlyn:
He sayd, that his deth shall be doubteous; and sayd soth, for men
thereof yet have doubte, and shullen for ever more,&mdash;for men wyt
not whether that he lyveth or is dede." See more ancient testimonies
in Selden's <i>Notes on Polyolbion, Song III.</i></p>

<p>This fragment being very incorrect and imperfect in the original
MS. hath received some conjectural emendations, and even a supplement
of three or four stanzas composed from the romance of
<i>Morte Arthur</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The two ballads here entitled <i>King Arthur's Death</i> and <i>The</i>
<i>Legend of King Arthur</i> are united in the Folio MS. (ed. Hales and
Furnivall, vol. i. p. 497), but they are evidently two distinct songs.
The first ballad forms part ii. of the MS. copy, which has fourteen
verses at the end not printed here. The last four verses are
printed at the end of the next ballad. Percy has taken great
liberties with his original, and has not left a single line unaltered,
as will be seen by comparing it with the original printed at the
end. Additional lines are also interpolated which are now enclosed
within brackets, and it will be seen that these unnecessary
amplifications do not improve the effect of the poem. It will also
be seen that in vv. 41-44 the father and son of the original are
changed into uncle and nephew.</p>

<p>This last scene in the life of King Arthur is the most beautiful
and touching portion of his history, and the romancers and minstrels
were never tired of telling it in every form.</p>

<p>According to one tradition Arthur still sleeps under St. Michael's
Mount ("the guarded Mount" of Milton's <i>Lycidas</i>), and according
to another beneath Richmond Castle, Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Mr. Willmott, in his edition of the <i>Reliques</i>, writes, "according
to popular superstition in Sicily, Arthur is preserved alive by his
sister la Fata Morgana, whose fairy palace is occasionally seen
from Reggio in the opposite sea of Messina."]</p></div>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">We</span> have here a short summary of K. Arthur's History
as given by Jeff. of Monmouth and the old chronicles,
with the addition of a few circumstances from the romance
Morte Arthur.&mdash;The ancient chronicle of Ger.
de Leew (quoted above in p. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>), seems to have been chiefly
followed: upon the authority of which we have restored some of
the names which were corrupted in the MS. and have transposed
one stanza, which appeared to be misplaced, (<i>viz.</i> that beginning
at ver. 49, which in the MS. followed ver. 36.)</p>

GLASGERION.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i045.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">An</span> ingenious Friend thinks that the following old Ditty
(which is printed from the Editor's folio MS.) may
possibly have given birth to the Tragedy of the <i>Orphan</i>,
in which Polidore intercepts Monimia's intended favours
to Castalio.</p>

<p>See what is said concerning the hero of this song, (who is celebrated
by <i>Chaucer</i> under the name of <i>Glaskyrion</i>) in the Essay
affixed to vol. i. note H. pt. iv. (2).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The hero of this ballad is the same as "gret Glascurion," placed
by Chaucer in the <i>House of Fame</i> by the side of Orpheus, and also
associated with Orpheus by Gawain Douglas in the <i>Palice of Honour</i>.
Percy's note in the Folio MS. is "It was not necessary to correct
this much for the press;" (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i. p. 246).
It will be seen, however, by the collations at the foot of the page
that several corrections were made, not always for the better. Thus
ver. 96, "who did his ladye grieve," is certainly weaker than the
original,&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And asked noe man noe leave."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jamieson (<i>Popular Ballads</i>, 1806, vol. i. p. 91) prints an inferior
version under the name of <i>Glenkindie</i>. Mr. Hale points out, however,
that "the Scotch version is more perfect in one point&mdash;in the
test question put to the page before the assignation is disclosed to
him:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'O mith I tell you, Gib my man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gin I a man had slain?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some such question perhaps would give more force to vv. 85-88 of
our version." He also very justly observes, "perhaps there is no
ballad that represents more keenly the great gulf fixed between
churl and noble&mdash;a profounder horror at the crossing over it."]</p></div>

[The explanation given by Percy in this note is an unfounded
guess. The Risp or tirling pin was very generally used in the
north to do the duty afterwards performed by the knocker. There
are several of these curious contrivances in the Antiquarian
Museum at Edinburgh, and they are described by D. Wilson in
his <i>Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time</i>, as follows,&mdash;"These
antique precursors of the knocker and bell are still frequently
to be met with in the steep turnpikes of the Old Town,
notwithstanding the cupidity of the Antiquarian collectors. The
ring is drawn up and down the notched iron rod and makes a very
audible noise within." (1848, vol. i. p. 97).]</p></div>

OLD ROBIN OF PORTINGALE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i050f.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">From</span> an ancient copy in the Editor's folio MS. which
was judged to require considerable corrections.</p>

<p>In the former edition the hero of this piece had been
called Sir Robin, but that title not being in the MS. is
now omitted.</p>

<p><i>Giles</i>, steward to a rich old merchant trading to <i>Portugal</i>, is
qualified with the title of <i>Sir</i>, not as being a knight, but rather,
I conceive, as having received an inferior order of priesthood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Percy's note in the MS. is as follows, "When I first set to
examine this I had not yet learnt to hold this old MS. in much
regard." Every line is altered, so that it has been necessary to add
a copy of the original, although the interest of the ballad itself is
not very great. Percy's most notable correction is the introduction
of 20 good knights to help Robin against his wife's twenty-four
traitors.]</p></div>

CHILD WATERS.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i058.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap"><i>Child</i></span> is frequently used by our old writers, as a Title.
It is repeatedly given to Prince Arthur in the Fairie
Queen: and the son of a king is in the same poem
called "Child Tristram." (B. 5. c. 11. st. 8. 13.&mdash;B. 6.
c. 2. st. 36.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> c. 8. st. 15.) In an old ballad quoted in
Shakespeare's <i>K. Lear</i>, the hero of Ariosto is called <i>Child Roland</i>.
Mr. Theobald supposes this use of the word was received along
with their romances from the Spaniards, with whom <i>Infante</i> signifies
a "Prince." A more eminent critic tells us, that "in the old
times of chivalry, the noble youth, who were candidates for knighthood,
during the time of their probation were called <i>Infans</i>, <i>Varlets</i>,
<i>Damoysels</i>, <i>Bacheliers</i>. The most noble of the youth were
particularly called <i>Infans</i>." (Vid. Warb. Shakesp.) A late commentator
on Spenser observes, that the Saxon word cniht, knight,
signifies also a "child." (See Upton's gloss to the F. Q.)</p>

<p>The Editor's folio MS. whence the following piece is taken (with
some corrections), affords several other ballads, wherein the word
<i>Child</i> occurs as a title: but in none of these it signifies "Prince."
See the song intitled <i>Gil Morrice</i>, in this volume.</p>

<p>It ought to be observed, that the Word <i>Child</i> or <i>Chield</i> is still
used in North Britain to denominate a Man, commonly with some
contemptuous character affixed to him, but sometimes to denote
Man in general.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This ballad gives us a curious insight into ancient manners,
and shows what were our forefathers' notions of the perfection of
female character. They would have agreed with the propounder
of the question&mdash;What is woman's mission? answer, sub-mission.
Like patient Grissel, Ellen bears worse sufferings than the Nut-Brown
Maid has to hear of, and in spite of the worst usage she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
never swerves from her devotion. This English version was the
first published, but the story is the same as <i>Lai le Fr&ecirc;ne</i>, preserved
in English in the Auchinleck MS. and in Norman in the <i>Lais</i> of
Marie, which were written about the year 1250.</p>

<p>Jamieson (<i>Popular Ballads and Songs</i>, 1806, vol. i. p. 113) published
his Scottish version under the more appropriate name of
<i>Burd Ellen</i>, who is the real heroine rather than the ruffian Waters
is the hero. Adopting the idea of Mrs. Hampden Pye, who wrote
a ballad on the same subject, he changes the character of the
catastrophe by adding three concluding stanzas to wind up the
story in an unhappy manner. Another version of the ballad, which
ends happily, is given in Kinloch's <i>Ancient Scottish Ballads</i> under
the title of Lady Margaret. A German version of this ballad was
made by the poet B&uuml;rger.]</p></div>

Editor's possession, written in the time of Q. Elizabeth.
Another Copy of it containing some variations, is reprinted
in the <i>Muses' Library</i>, p. 295, from an ancient
miscellany, intitled <i>England's Helicon</i>, 1600, 4to. The author was
<i>Nicholas Breton</i>, a writer of some fame in the reign of Elizabeth;
who also published an interlude intitled <i>An old man's lesson and</i>
<i>a young man's love</i>, 4to., and many other little pieces in prose and
verse, the titles of which may be seen in Winstanley, Ames' <i>Typog.</i>
and Osborne's <i>Harl. Catalog.</i> &amp;c.&mdash;He is mentioned with great
respect by <i>Meres</i>, in his 2d pt. of <i>Wit's Common-wealth</i>, 1598,
f. 283, and is alluded to in Beaumont and Fletcher's <i>Scornful Lady</i>,
act ii., and again in <i>Wit without Money</i>, act iii.&mdash;See Whalley's
<i>Ben Jonson</i>, vol. iii. p. 103.</p>

<p>The present Edition is improved by a copy in <i>England's Helicon</i>,
edit. 1614, 8vo.</p>

<p>This little Pastoral is one of the Songs in "The Honourable
Entertainment gieven to the Queenes Majestie in Progresse at
Elvetham in Hampshire, by the R. H. the Earle of Hertford,
1591, 4to." (Printed by Wolfe. No name of author.) See in
that pamphlet,</p>

<p>"On Wednesday morning about 9 o'clock, as her Majestie
opened a casement of her gallerie window, ther were 3 excellent
musitians, who being disguised in auncient country attire, did
greet her with a pleasant song of <i>Corydon and Phillida</i>, made in
3 parts of purpose. The song, as well for the worth of the dittie
as the aptnesse of the note thereto applied, it pleased her Highnesse
after it had been once sung to command it againe, and
highly to grace it with her cheerefull acceptance and commendation.</p>

LITTLE MUSGRAVE AND LADY BARNARD.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i068.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> ballad is ancient, and has been popular; we find it
quoted in many old plays. See Beaum. and Fletcher's
<i>Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>, 4to. 1613, act v. sc. iii.
<i>The Varietie, a comedy</i>, 12mo. 1649, act iv. &amp;c. In Sir
William Davenant's play, <i>The Witts</i>, a. iii. a gallant thus boasts of
himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Limber and sound! besides I sing Musgrave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for Chevy-chace no lark comes near me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the Pepys <i>Collection</i>, vol. iii. p. 314, is an imitation of this
old song, in 33 stanzas, by a more modern pen, with many alterations,
but evidently for the worse.</p>

<p>This is given from an old printed copy in the British Museum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
with corrections; some of which are from a fragment in the Editor's
folio MS. It is also printed in Dryden's <i>Collection of Miscellaneous</i>
<i>Poems</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The copy of this ballad in the Folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall,
vol. i. p. 119) is a mutilated fragment consisting of only ten complete
stanzas and three half ones. The oldest entire copy is to be found
in <i>Wit Restor'd</i>, 1658, where it is called <i>the</i> old <i>ballad of little</i>
<i>Musgrave</i>, which is given by Professor Child (<i>English and Scottish</i>
<i>Ballads</i>, vol. ii. p. 15) in preference to Percy's. This version, not
very exactly transcribed, is printed in Dryden's <i>Miscellany Poems</i>
(1716, vol. iii. 312), and Ritson (<i>Ancient Songs and Ballads</i>, vol. ii.
p. 116) copied it from thence. Ritson writes of one of Percy's
statements above: "Dr. Percy indeed, by some mistake, gives it
as from an old printed copy in the British Museum; observing
that 'In the Pepys collection is an imitation of this old song in
a different measure, by a more modern pen, with many alterations,
but evidently for the worse.' It is very true, and not less so that
the only copies in the museum (for there are two) are more recent
impressions of this identical <i>imitation</i>."</p>

<p>It is the 14th stanza slightly altered which is quoted in the
<i>Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And some they whistled, and some they sung,<br /></span>

<span class="i18">Away Musgrave, away."<br /></span>

<p>There are several Scottish versions, in which the reciters have
altered the locality. Jamieson has printed one which he calls
<i>Lord Barnaby</i> (<i>Popular Ballads and Songs</i>, i. 170). He states
that he had heard it repeated both in Morayshire and in the
southern counties.</p>

<p>Motherwell gives the air in his <i>Minstrelsy</i> which he noted down
from oral communication, and this verse&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Mr. J. H. Dixon includes a version entitled <i>Lord Burnett and</i>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> ballad (given from an old black-letter copy, with
some corrections) was popular in the time of Q. Elizabeth,
being usually printed with her picture before it, as
Hearne informs us in his preface to <i>Gul. Neubrig. Hist.</i>
<i>Oxon.</i> 1719, 8vo. vol. i. p. lxx. It is quoted in Fletcher's comedy
of the <i>Pilgrim</i>, act iv. sc. 2.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He set her on a milk white steed." (l. 85.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are several Scottish versions given by Buchan, Kinloch, and
Motherwell. The latter claims greater antiquity for his over Percy's.
It appears, however, to be a southern ballad adapted by the Scotch
and improved in its humour. The heroine practices various artifices
to maintain the character of a "beggar's brat" when riding
back with <i>Earl Richard</i>.]</p></div>

<p>1. <i>Lord Thomas and Fair Annet</i>, (see book iii. No. 4.)</p>

<p>3. <i>Sweet Willie and Fair Annie</i>, (Jamieson's <i>Popular Ballads</i>,

GIL MORRICE.</h3>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Scottish Ballad.</span>
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i091.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> following piece hath run thro' two editions in Scotland:
the second was printed at Glasgow in 1755, 8vo.
Prefixed to them both is an advertisement, setting forth
that the preservation of this poem was owing "to a
lady, who favoured the printers with a copy, as it was carefully
collected from the mouths of old women and nurses;" and "any
reader that can render it more correct or complete," is desired to
oblige the public with such improvements. In consequence of
this advertisement sixteen additional verses have been produced
and handed about in manuscript, which are here inserted in their
proper places: (these are from ver. 109, to ver. 121, and from ver.
124, to ver. 129, but are perhaps, after all, only an ingenious interpolation.)</p>

<p>As this poem lays claim to a pretty high antiquity, we have
assigned it a place among our early pieces: though, after all, there
is reason to believe it has received very considerable modern improvements:
for in the Editor's ancient MS. collection is a very
old imperfect copy of the same ballad: wherein though the leading
features of the story are the same, yet the colouring here is so much
improved and heightened, and so many additional strokes are
thrown in, that it is evident the whole has undergone a revisal.</p>

<p>This little pathetic tale suggested the plot of the tragedy of
<i>Douglas</i>.</p>

<p>Since it was first printed, the Editor has been assured that the
foregoing ballad is still current in many parts of Scotland, where
the hero is universally known by the name of <i>Child Maurice</i>, pronounced
by the common people <i>Cheild</i> or <i>Cheeld</i>; which occasioned
the mistake.</p>

<p>It may be proper to mention that other copies read ver. 110,
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shot frae the golden sun"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And ver. 116, as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His een like azure sheene."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>N.B. The Editor's MS. instead of "lord Barnard," has "John
Stewart;" and instead of "Gil Morrice," <i>Child Maurice</i>, which last
is probably the original title. See above, p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>[<i>Gil Maurice</i> is one of the most popular of the old ballads and it
is also one of the most corrupt. The present copy is so tinkered
that it is not surprising Burns regarded the ballad as a modern composition
and classed it with <i>Hardyknute</i>, a position afterwards taken
up by Robert Chambers in his pamphlet <i>The Romantic Scottish Ballads,</i>
<i>their epoch and authorship</i>. The fact however that the story
is preserved in the Folio MS. and also in several other forms obtained
from tradition prove it to be an authentic ballad. Jamieson
thinks it has all the appearance of being a true narrative of some
incident that had really taken place. Motherwell devotes several
pages of his <i>Minstrelsy</i> (pp. 257-286) to an account of the various
versions. He says that tradition points out the "green wood" of
the ballad in the ancient forest of Dundaff in Stirlingshire.</p>

<p>The request for additions mentioned above by Percy was a
tempting bait eagerly caught at, and the edition of 1755 was a
made up text with additional verses. Besides vv. 109-120, 125-128,
which are known to be interpolations, Professor Child (<i>English</i>
<i>and Scottish Ballads</i>, vol. ii. p. 38) also degrades to the foot of
the page the verses from 177 to the end, on the authority of Jamieson,
who says, that "having been attentive to all the proceedings
in most of the trials at the bar of ballad criticism I may venture
to hazard an opinion that the genuine text ends with 'ver. 176.'"
Ritson and Motherwell are of the same opinion. Sir Walter Scott
notes on the interpolated verses, "In the beautiful and simple
ballad of <i>Gil Morris</i> some affected person has stuck in one or
two factitious verses which, like vulgar persons in a drawing room,
betray themselves by their over-finery."</p>

<p>The fine copy in the Folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii.
p. 500), which Jamieson thought debased and totally unworthy of
the subject, which Chambers calls "a poor, bald imperfect composition,"
and Mr. Hales more accurately designates as "a noble
specimen of our ballad poetry in all its strength," was first printed
by Jamieson (<i>Popular Ballads and Songs</i>, 1806, vol. i. p. 8), and
is now added to the present version. The last stanza of the Folio
MS. copy is identical with the last stanza but one of <i>Little Musgrave</i>
<i>and Lady Barnard</i>, with which it seems to have some
connection both in subject and name.</p>

<p>Prof. Aytoun points out that vv. 51-58 of Percy's copy, which
are now placed within brackets, are taken from <i>Lady Maisry</i>, a
ballad obtained from recitation and printed by Jamieson (vol. i.
p. 73).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is however only fair to Percy to say that he printed <i>Gil Morice</i>
before <i>Lady Maisry</i> was published.</p>

<p>Gray wrote to a friend, "I have got the old Scotch ballad on
which <i>Douglas</i> was founded; it is divine, and as long as from
hence [Cambridge] to Aston."</p>

<p>Jamieson says, on the authority of Sir Walter Scott, that after
the appearance of Home's <i>Douglas</i> six additional stanzas, beginning&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She heard him speak, but fell despair<br /></span>

<p>were written to complete the ballad, and in accordance with the
final catastrophe of the tragedy Lord Barnard rushes into the
thickest of the fight&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"and meets the death he sought."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the play was produced in Edinburgh in 1756 the heroine
was named Lady Barnard, and the alteration to Lady Randolph
was made on its appearance in England in the following year.</p>

<p>Jamieson gives three stanzas of a traditional version of the
ballad, the whole of which neither he nor Motherwell could
recover, although Mr. Sharpe told the latter that they were incorporated
in an Annandale version which contained a novel feature
in the story.</p>

<p>Motherwell prints a version called <i>Chield Morice</i>, which he took
down from the recitation of an old woman of 70 in 1827, and
which she had learned in infancy from her grandmother. She told
Motherwell "that at a later period of her life she also committed
to memory <i>Gill Morice</i>, which began with young lasses like her
to be a greater favourite, and more fashionable than the set which
her grandmother and other old folks used to sing under the title
of <i>Chield Morice</i>." He also prints <i>Child Moryce</i>, taken down
from the singing of widow M'Cormick of Paisley in 1825, and
adds his opinion that Morice and Maurice are evident corruptions
of Norice&mdash;a foster child. The story of Langhorne's <i>Owen of</i>
<i>Carron</i> is also taken from this ballad.]</p></div>

THE LEGEND OF SIR GUY</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i107c.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Contains</span> a short summary of the exploits of this
famous champion, as recorded in the old story books;
and is commonly intitled, "A pleasant song of the
valiant deeds of chivalry atchieved by that noble knight
sir Guy of Warwick, who, for the love of fair Phelis, became a
hermit, and dyed in a cave of craggy rocke, a mile distant from
Warwick."</p>

<p>The history of Sir Guy, tho' now very properly resigned to
children, was once admired by all readers of wit and taste: for
taste and wit had once their childhood. Although of English
growth, it was early a favourite with other nations: it appeared in
French in 1525; and is alluded to in the old Spanish romance
<i>Tirante el Blanco</i>, which, it is believed, was written not long after
the year 1430. See advertisement to the French translation, 2
vols. 12mo.</p>

<p>The original whence all these stories are extracted is a very
ancient romance in old English verse, which is quoted by Chaucer
as a celebrated piece even in his time (viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Men speken of romances of price,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Horne childe and Ippotis,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Bevis, and sir Guy," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>R. of Thop.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and was usually sung to the harp at Christmas dinners and
brideales, as we learn from Puttenham's <i>Art of Poetry</i>, 4to. 1589.</p>

<p>This ancient romance is not wholly lost. An imperfect copy in
black letter, "Imprynted at London&mdash;&mdash;for Wylliam Copland,"
in 34 sheets 4to. without date, is still preserved among Mr. Garrick's
collection of old plays. As a specimen of the poetry of
this antique rhymer, take his description of the dragon mentioned
in v. 105 of the following ballad:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir William Dugdale is of opinion that the story of Guy is
not wholly apocryphal, tho' he acknowledges the monks have
sounded out his praises too hyperbolically. In particular, he
gives the duel fought with the Danish champion as a real historical
truth, and fixes the date of it in the year 926, &AElig;tat. Guy, 67. See
his <i>Warwickshire</i>.</p>

<p>The following is written upon the same plan as ballad v. book
i., but which is the original and which the copy cannot be decided.
This song is ancient, as may be inferred from the idiom preserved
in the margin, v. 94, 102: and was once popular, as appears
from Fletcher's <i>Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>, act 2, sc. ult.</p>

<p>It is here published from an ancient MS. copy in the editor's old
folio volume, collated with two printed ones, one of which is in
black letter in the Pepys collection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Guy was one of the most popular of the heroes of romance, and
the Folio MS. contains three pieces upon his history, viz., the two
printed here and <i>Guy and Colbrand</i>.</p>

<p>The original of the present ballad in the Folio MS., entitled
<i>Guy and Phillis</i> (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 201), is a
mere fragment beginning with verse 89. Percy tore out certain
leaves to send to the printer, and in consequence the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
<i>King Estmere</i> and the beginning of this ballad are lost. Alterations
have been made in nearly every verse by the help of the printed
copies. <i>Guy and Phillis</i> was entered on the Stationers' books, 5th
January, 1591-2.</p>

<p>We are told by Dugdale that an English traveller, about the
year 1410, was hospitably received at Jerusalem by the Soldan's
lieutenant, who, hearing that Lord Beauchamp "was descended
from the famous Guy of Warwick, whose story they had in books
of their own language, invited him to his palace; and royally
feasting him, presented him with three precious stones of great
value, besides divers cloaths of silk and gold given to his servants."
Dugdale's authority for this story was John Rous, a priest of the
chapel at Guy's Cliff, near Warwick, who compiled a biography
of the hero, in which all the incidents of the romance are narrated
as sober fact. The constant praises of the hero bored some people,
and Corbet, in his <i>Iter Boreale</i>, expressed the hope that he should
hear no more of him&mdash;</p></div>

GUY AND AMARANT.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i114.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> Editor found this Poem in his ancient folio manuscript
among the old ballads; he was desirous therefore
that it should still accompany them; and as it is not
altogether devoid of merit, its insertion here will be
pardoned.</p>

<p>Although this piece seems not imperfect, there is reason to
believe that it is only part of a much larger poem, which contained
the whole history of sir Guy: for upon comparing it with the common
story book 12mo. we find the latter to be nothing more than
this poem reduced to prose: which is only effected by now and
then altering the rhyme, and throwing out some few of the poetical
ornaments. The disguise is so slight, that it is an easy matter to
pick complete stanzas in any page of that book.</p>

<p>The author of this poem has shown some invention. Though
he took the subject from the old romance quoted before, he has
adorned it afresh, and made the story intirely his own.</p>

<p>This poem has been discovered to be a fragment of, "The
famous historie of Guy earl of Warwicke, by <i>Samuel Rowlands</i>,
London, printed by J. Bell, 1649, 4to." in xii cantos, beginning
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When dreadful Mars in armour every day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whether the edition in 1649, was the first, is not known, but the
author <i>Sam. Rowlands</i> was one of the minor poets who lived in
the reigns of Q. Elizabeth and James I. and perhaps later. His
other poems are chiefly of the religious kind, which makes it probable
that the hist. of Guy was one of his earliest performances.&mdash;There
are extant of his (1.) "<i>The betraying of Christ, Judas in</i>
<i>dispaire, the seven words of our Saviour on the crosse, with other</i>
<i>poems on the passion, &amp;c.</i> 1598, 4to. (Ames Typ. p. 428.)&mdash;(2.) <i>A</i>
<i>Theatre of delightful Recreation.</i> Lond. printed for A. Johnson,
1605," 4to. (Penes editor.) This is a book of poems on subjects
chiefly taken from the old Testament. (3.) "<i>Memory of Christ's</i>
<i>miracles, in verse.</i> Lond. 1618, 4to." (4.) "<i>Heaven's glory, earth's</i>
<i>vanity, and hell's horror.</i> Lond. 1638, 8vo." (These two in Bod.
Cat.)</p>

<p>In the present edition the following poem has been much
improved from the printed copy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This poem is a very poor thing and looks very like a joke in
some parts. In the Folio MS. Percy has written "By the elegance
of language and easy flow of the versification this poem should be
more modern than the rest."</p>

<p>Mr. Furnivall adds to this expression of opinion the following
note, "the first bombastic rhodomontade affair in the book. Certainly
modern and certainly bad" (Folio MS. ed. Hales and Furnivall,
vol. ii. p. 136.) Collations from the MS. are added at the
foot of the page.]</p></div>

FAIR MARGARET AND SWEET WILLIAM.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i124.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> seems to be the old song quoted in Fletcher's
<i>Knight of the burning pestle</i>, acts 2d and 3d; altho' the
six lines there preserved are somewhat different from
those in the ballad, as it stands at present. The reader
will not wonder at this, when he is informed that this is only given
from a modern printed copy picked up on a stall. It's full title is
<i>Fair Margaret's Misfortunes; or Sweet William's frightful dreams</i>
<i>on his wedding night, with the sudden death and burial of those noble</i>
<i>lovers</i>.&mdash;</p>

<p>The lines preserved in the play are this distich,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You are no love for me, Margaret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am no love for you."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the following stanza,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When it was grown to dark midnight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all were fast asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In came Margarets grimly ghost<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And stood at Williams feet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines have acquired an importance by giving birth to one
of the most beautiful ballads in our own or any language. See
the song intitled <i>Margaret's Ghost</i>, at the end of this volume.</p>

<p>Since the first edition some improvements have been inserted,
which were communicated by a lady of the first distinction, as she
had heard this song repeated in her infancy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The ballads on the two lovers Margaret and William are
numerous, culminating as they do in Mallet's <i>William and Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>garet</i>.
See <i>Sweet William's Ghost</i> (No. 6 in this book) and
Mallet's ballad (No. 16 of book iii). The present ballad is also
in the Douce Collection and in that of the late Mr. George Daniel.
Jamieson prints (<i>Popular Ballads and Songs</i>, 1806, vol. i. p. 22)
a ballad entitled <i>Sweet Willie and Fair Annie</i>, which may be
divided into two parts, the first resembling <i>Lord Thomas and Fair</i>
<i>Elinor</i>, and the second, <i>Fair Annie's Ghost</i>, is still more like the
following ballad.</p>

<p>Mr. Chappell remarks, "Another point deserving notice in the
old ballad is that one part of it has furnished the principal subject
of the modern burlesque ballad <i>Lord Lovel</i>, and another that of
T. Hood's song, <i>Mary's Ghost</i>."]</p></div>

<p>[It is not clear why Percy separated this English version of

into tears with <i>Johnny Armstrong's Last Good Night</i>, or the

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[In the previous ballad (No. 4) and in Mallet's <i>William</i>
<i>and Margaret</i> it is Margaret who appears to William, but
in the present one and in some other versions William is made
to die first. In <i>Clerk Saunders</i> (<i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>)
Scott has joined two distinct stories, and the second part, in
which the spirit of Clerk Saunders appears to May Margaret,
closely resembles the present ballad. Besides these there are
two other versions. Kinloch's, entitled <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><i>Sweet William and May</i>
<i>Margaret</i>, and Motherwell's <i>William and Marjorie</i>. Dr. Rimbault
points out that the chief incidents in B&uuml;rger's <i>Leonora</i> resemble
those in this ballad.</p>

<p>The last two stanzas are probably Ramsay's own.]</p></div>

THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER OF ISLINGTON.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i135f.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">From</span> an ancient black-letter copy in the Pepys <i>Collection</i>,
with some improvements communicated by a lady as
she had heard the same recited in her youth. The full
title is, <i>True love requited: Or, the Bailiff's daughter of</i>
<i>Islington</i>.</p>

<p><i>Islington</i> in Norfolk is probably the place here meant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Copies of this charming old ballad are found in all the large
collections, and two tunes are associated with it.</p>

<p>Percy's suggestion that Islington in Norfolk is referred to is not
a probable one, and there seems to be no reason for depriving the
better known Islington of the south of the honour of having given
birth to the bailiff's daughter. Islington at the time when this
ballad was written was a country village quite unconnected with
London, and a person who represented "a squier minstrel of
Middlesex" made a speech before Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth
in 1575, in which he declared "how the worshipful village of Islington
[was] well knooen too bee one of the most auncient and best
tounz in England, next to London."]</p></div>

one in the British Museum, the other in the Pepys

here referred to is preserved in the <i>Muses Library</i>, 8vo. p. 281.

opens with some pretty rural images, viz.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hales thinks it possible that this ballad was written by the
same author as <i>The Children in the Wood</i>&mdash;"the same facility of

extreme simplicity characterise both ballads."</p>

<p>Mr. Chappell says that <i>Chevy Chace</i> was sometimes sung to the
tune of <i>In Pescod time</i>, as were the <i>Bride's burial</i> (No. 12), and
<i>Lady Isabella's Tragedy</i> (No. 14). The various readings from the
original MS. are noted at the foot of the page.]</p></div>

<p>[There has been considerable difference of opinion among ballad
collectors relative to this beautiful song. Some suppose it to be
a portion of the ballad entitled <i>Lord Jamie Douglas</i>, which relates
to James Douglas, second Marquis of Douglas, who married Lady
Barbara Erskine, eldest daughter of John, ninth Earl of Mar, on
the seventh of September, 1670, and afterwards repudiated her
on account of a false accusation of adultery made against her by
Lowrie, laird of Blackwood. Prof. Aytoun, however, believes that
certain verses of <i>Waly Waly</i> have wrongly been mixed up with
<i>Lord Jamie Douglas</i>. There is very little doubt that the song was
in existence long before 1670, and it also appears to be the
lamentation of a forsaken girl rather than of a wife. Mr. Stenhouse
and others considered it to belong to the age of Queen
Mary and to refer to some affair at Court. Aytoun writes, "there is
also evidence that it was composed before 1566, for there is extant
a MS. of that year in which some of the lines are transcribed," but
Mr. Maidment gives the following opinion&mdash;"that the ballad is
of ancient date is undoubted, but we are not quite prepared to
admit that it goes back as far as 1566, the date of the manuscript
transcribed by Thomas Wode from an ancient church music book
compiled by Dean John Angus, Andrew Blackhall, and others, in
which it said the first [second] stanza is thus parodied:&mdash;</p></div>

maiden; it was afterwards hung up over her customary seat in
church. Sometimes a pair of white gloves, or paper cut to the
shape of gloves, was hung beneath the garland. Chaplets of the
kind still hang in some of the Derbyshire churches, and at Hathersage
in that county the custom is still retained."&mdash;(<i>Transactions of</i>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Given</span> from two ancient copies, one in black-print, in
the Pepys Collection: the other in the Editor's folio
MS. Each of these contained a stanza not found in
the other. What seemed the best readings were
selected from both.</p>

<p>This song is quoted as very popular in Walton's <i>Compleat Angler</i>,
chap. ii. It is more ancient than the ballad of <i>Robin Good-Fellow</i>
printed below, which yet is supposed to have been written by Ben.
Jonson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The Milk-woman in Walton's <i>Angler</i> says, "What song was it,
I pray you? Was it <i>Come shepherds deck your heads</i>, or <i>As at</i>
<i>noon Dulcina rested</i>?"</p>

<p>In the Registers of the Stationers' Company, under date of
May 22, 1615, there is an entry transferring the right of publication
from one printer to another of <i>A Ballett of Dulcina to the tune of</i>
<i>Forgoe me nowe, come to me sone</i>. Mr. Chappell also tells us that
<i>Dulcina</i> was one of the tunes to the "Psalms and Songs of Sion,
turned into the language and set to the tunes of a strange land,"
1642.</p>

<p>The editors of the Folio MS., more scrupulous than the bishop,
have not printed this song in its proper place, but have turned it
into the Supplement of <i>Loose and Humourous Songs</i> (p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>). The
third stanza of the MS. beginning</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>is not printed in the present copy. The third stanza here is the
fourth of the MS., and the fourth stanza is not in the MS. at all.</p>

<p>Cayley and Ellis attribute this song to Raleigh, but without
sufficient authority.]</p></div>

THE KING OF FRANCE'S DAUGHTER.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i161.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> story of this ballad seems to be taken from an incident
in the domestic history of Charles the Bald, king
of France. His daughter Judith was betrothed to
Ethelwulph king of England: but before the marriage
was consummated, Ethelwulph died, and she returned to France:
whence she was carried off by Baldwyn, Forester of Flanders;
who, after many crosses and difficulties, at length obtained the
king's consent to their marriage, and was made Earl of Flanders.
This happened about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 863.&mdash;See Rapin, Henault, and the
French historians.</p>

<p>The following copy is given from the Editor's ancient folio MS.
collated with another in black-letter in the Pepys Collection, intitled,
<i>An excellent Ballad of a prince of England's courtship to the</i>
<i>king of France's daughter, &amp;c.</i> To the tune of <i>Crimson Velvet</i>.</p>

<p>Many breaches having been made in this old song by the hand
of time, principally (as might be expected) in the quick returns
of the rhime; an attempt is here made to repair them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This ballad was written by Thomas Deloney, who included it
in his <i>Garland of Goodwill</i> (Percy Society, vol. xxx. p. 52). It is,
as Percy points out, founded on history, but Deloney paid little
attention to facts. All the first part of the poem, which tells of the
miserable end of the English prince of suitable age to the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
French princess, is fiction. Judith was Ethelwulf's wife for about
two years, and on the death of her husband she married his son
Ethelbert. The only historical fact that is followed in the ballad
is the marriage of Judith with Baldwin, Great Forester of France,
from which union descended Matilda, the wife of William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>The copy in the Folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. iii.
p. 441) is entitled "In the Dayes of Olde." Percy altered it considerably,
sometimes following the printed copy and sometimes the
MS.</p>

<p>Mr. Hales suggests that the name of the tune is derived from
the dress of the princess, described in vv. 185-6,&mdash;</p></div>

THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i169t.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this very popular ballad (which has
been set in so favourable a light by the <i>Spectator</i>, No.
85.) seems to be taken from an old play, intitled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span><i>Two lamentable Tragedies; The one of the murder</i>
<i>of Maister Beech, a chandler in Thames streete, &amp;c. The other</i>
<i>of a young child murthered in a wood by two ruffins, with the</i>
<i>consent of his unkle.</i> By Rob. Yarrington, 1601, 4to. Our ballad-maker
has strictly followed the play in the description of the
father and mother's dying charge: in the uncle's promise to take
care of their issue: his hiring two ruffians to destroy his ward,
under pretence of sending him to school: their chusing a wood
to perpetrate the murder in: one of the ruffians relenting, and
a battle ensuing, &amp;c. In other respects he has departed from the
play. In the latter the scene is laid in Padua: there is but one
child: which is murdered by a sudden stab of the unrelenting
ruffian: he is slain himself by his less bloody companion; but ere
he dies gives the other a mortal wound: the latter living just long
enough to impeach the uncle; who, in consequence of this impeachment,
is arraigned and executed by the hand of justice, &amp;c.
Whoever compares the play with the ballad, will have no doubt
but the former is the original: the language is far more obsolete,
and such a vein of simplicity runs through the whole performance,
that, had the ballad been written first, there is no doubt but every
circumstance of it would have been received into the drama:
whereas this was probably built on some Italian novel.</p>

<p>Printed from two ancient copies, one of them in black-letter in
the Pepys Collection. Its title at large is, <i>The Children in the</i>
<i>Wood; or, The Norfolk Gentleman's Last Will and Testament: To</i>
<i>the tune of Rogero, &amp;c.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Ritson thought he had refuted Percy's statement that the play
was older than the ballad by pointing out that the latter was
entered in the Stationers' books in 1595, but I find in Baker's
<i>Biographia Dramatica</i> an assertion that Yarrington's play was not
printed "till many years after it was written." The following is
the form of the entry at Stationers' Hall, "15 Oct. 1595. Thomas
Millington entred for his copie under th[e h]andes of bothe the
Wardens a ballad intituled <i>The Norfolk Gent, his Will and Testament</i>
<i>and howe he commytted the keepinge of his children to his owne</i>
<i>brother whoe delte most wickedly with them and howe God plagued</i>
<i>him for it.</i>" Sharon Turner and Miss Halsted favoured the rather
untenable opinion that the wicked uncle was intended to represent
Richard III., and therefore that the date of the ballad was much
earlier than that usually claimed for it. Turner writes in his <i>History</i>
<i>of England</i>, "I have sometimes fancied that the popular
ballad may have been written at this time on Richard and his
nephews before it was quite safe to stigmatize him more openly."</p>

<p>Wailing, or Wayland Wood, a large cover near Walton in Norfolk
is the place which tradition assigns to the tragedy, but the
people of Wood Dalling also claim the honour for their village.</p>

<p>Addison speaks of the ballad as "one of the darling songs of
the common people, [which] has been the delight of most English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>men
in some part of their age," and points out that the circumstance</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... robin-red-breast piously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did cover them with leaves,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>has a parallel in Horace, who tells us that when he was a child,
fallen asleep in a desert wood, the turtle doves took pity on him
and covered him with leaves.</p>

<p>The popular belief that the robin covers dead bodies with leaves
(probably founded on the habits of the bird) is of considerable
antiquity. The passage in Cymbeline (act iv. sc. 2) naturally
occurs as the chief illustration:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... "the ruddock would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With charitable bill....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... bring thee all this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To winter-ground thy corse."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Webster's <i>White Devil</i>, act v., we read:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Call for the robin red breast and the wren<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since o'er shady groves they hover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with leaves and flowers do cover<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The friendless bodies of unburied men."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The critics suppose Webster to have imitated Shakespere here,
but there is no ground for any such supposition. The industry of
Reed, Steevens, and Douce has supplied us with several passages
from old literature in which this characteristic of the robin is referred
to.</p>

<p>In "<i>Cornucopi&aelig;, or, divers Secrets</i>; wherein is contained the rare
secrets of man, beasts, fowles, fishes, trees, plants, stones, and
such like, most pleasant and profitable, and not before committed
to bee printed in English. Newlie drawen out of divers Latine
Authors into English by Thomas Johnson," 4to. London, 1596,
occurs the following passage:&mdash;"The robin red-breast if he find a
man or woman dead will cover all his face with mosse, and some
thinke that if the body should remaine unburied that hee woulde
cover the whole body also."</p>

<p>This little secret of Johnson is copied by Thomas Lupton into
his <i>A Thousand Notable Things of sundrie sorts newly corrected</i>,
1601, where it appears as No. 37 of book i.</p>

<p>Michael Drayton has the following lines in his poem, <i>The Owl</i>:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cov'ring with moss the dead's unclosed eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little red-breast teacheth charitie."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Dekker's <i>Villanies discovered by lanthorn and candlelight</i>, 1616,
we read, "They that cheere up a prisoner but with their sight are
Robin red-breasts, that bring strawes in their bils to cover a dead
man in extremit&igrave;e." This is sufficient evidence that the belief was
wide-spread.]</p></div>

THE KING AND MILLER OF MANSFIELD.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i178.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been a favourite subject with our English ballad-makers
to represent our kings conversing, either by
accident or design, with the meanest of their subjects.
Of the former kind, besides this song of the King and
the Miller; we have K. Henry and the Soldier; K. James I. and
the Tinker; K. William III. and the Forrester &amp;c. Of the latter
sort, are K. Alfred and the Shepherd; K. Edward IV. and the
Tanner;<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> K. Henry VIII. and the Cobler, &amp;c.&mdash;A few of the
best of these are admitted into this collection. Both the author
of the following ballad, and others who have written on the same
plan, seem to have copied a very ancient poem, intitled <i>John</i>
<i>the Reeve</i>, which is built on an adventure of the same kind, that
happened between K. Edward Longshanks, and one of his Reeves
or Bailiffs. This is a piece of great antiquity, being written before
the time of Edward IV. and for its genuine humour, diverting incidents,
and faithful picture of rustic manners, is infinitely superior
to all that have been since written in imitation of it. The Editor
has a copy in his ancient folio MS. but its length rendered it improper
for this volume, it consisting of more than 900 lines. It
contains also some corruptions, and the Editor chuses to defer its
publication in hopes that some time or other he shall be able to
remove them.</p>

<p>The following is printed, with corrections, from the editor's
folio MS. collated with an old black-letter copy in the Pepys
Col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>lection, intitled <i>A pleasant ballad of K. Henry II. and the Miller</i>
<i>of Mansfield, &amp;c.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This ballad of <i>Henry II. and the Miller of Mansfield</i> cannot be
traced farther back than the end of Elizabeth's reign or the beginning
of James's. One of the three copies in the Roxburghe
Collection is dated by Mr. Chappell between 1621 and 1655, and
the copy in the Folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 147)
was written about the same period. (See Roxburghe <i>Ballads</i>, ed.
Chappell, vol. i. p. 538.)</p>

<p>As there are earlier copies than the one in the Folio MS. it has
not been thought necessary to add Collations.</p>

<p><i>John the Reeve</i>, referred to above, is one of the earliest and most
interesting of this large class of tales. It was printed for the first
time in Hales and Furnivall's edition of the MS. (vol. ii. p. 550)
with a valuable introduction.</p>

<p>This spirited poem was probably written originally in the middle
of the fifteenth century. "It professes to describe an incident
that took place in the days of King Edward. It adds:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of that name were Kings <i>three</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Edward with the long shanks was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">A lord of great renown.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The poem then was written after the death of Edward III.; that is,
after 1377, and before the accession of Edward IV., that is before
1461."]</p></div>

THE SHEPHERD'S RESOLUTION.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i188.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful old song was written by a poet, whose
name would have been utterly forgotten, if it had not
been preserved by <i>Swift</i>, as a term of contempt.
<i>Dryden</i> and <i>Wither</i> are coupled by him like the
<i>Bavius</i> and <i>M&aelig;vius</i> of Virgil. <i>Dryden</i>, however, has had justice
done him by posterity: and as for <i>Wither</i>, though of subordinate
merit, that he was not altogether devoid of genius, will be
judged from the following stanzas. The truth is, <i>Wither</i> was a
very voluminous party-writer: and as his political and satyrical
strokes rendered him extremely popular in his life-time; so afterwards,
when these were no longer relished, they totally consigned
his writings to oblivion.</p>

<p><i>George Wither</i> was born June 11, 1588, and in his younger
years distinguished himself by some pastoral pieces, that were not
inelegant; but growing afterwards involved in the political and
religious disputes in the times of James I. and Charles I. he
employed his poetical vein in severe pasquils on the court and
clergy, and was occasionally a sufferer for the freedom of his pen.
In the civil war that ensued, he exerted himself in the service of
the Parliament, and became a considerable sharer in the spoils.
He was even one of those provincial tyrants, whom Oliver distributed
over the kingdom, under the name of Major Generals;
and had the fleecing of the county of Surrey: but surviving the
Restoration, he outlived both his power and his affluence; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
giving vent to his chagrin in libels on the court, was long a
prisoner in Newgate and the Tower. He died at length on the
2d of May, 1667.</p>

<p>During the whole course of his life, <i>Wither</i> was a continual
publisher; having generally for opponent, <i>Taylor</i> the Water-poet.
The long list of his productions may be seen in Wood's <i>Athen&aelig;.</i>
<i>Oxon.</i> vol. ii. His most popular satire is intitled, <i>Abuses whipt</i>
<i>and stript</i>, 1613. His most poetical pieces were eclogues, intitled,
<i>The Shepherd's Hunting</i>, 1615, 8vo. and others printed at the end
of Browne's <i>Shepherd's Pipe</i>, 1614, 8vo. The following sonnet is
extracted from a long pastoral piece of his, intitled, <i>The Mistresse</i>
<i>of Philarete</i>, 1622, 8vo. which is said in the preface to be one of
the Author's first poems; and may therefore be dated as early as
any of the foregoing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This favourite song appeared in 1619, appended to Wither's
<i>Fidelia</i>, and again in his <i>Juvenilia</i> in 1633 in <i>Fair Virtue the</i>
<i>mistress of Philarete</i>. It was reprinted again and again, and
occurs in the Folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. ii. p. 50).</p>

<p>Mr. Chappell refers to a copy in the Pepys Collection entitled,
<i>A New Song of a young man's opinion of the difference between good</i>
<i>and bad women</i>, the first line of which is, "Shall I <i>wrestling</i> in
despaire?" This reading seems to have been pretty popular, as
Mr. Chappell gives two instances of the tune being called "<i>Shall</i>
<i>I wrastle in despair?</i>" Mr. Chappell prints a song in the same
metre and with a similar burden, which has been attributed on
insufficient evidence to Sir Walter Raleigh. The first stanza is as
follows:&mdash;</p></div>

QUEEN DIDO.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i191.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Such</span> is the title given in the editor's folio MS.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> to this
excellent old ballad, which, in the common printed
copies, is inscribed, <i>Eneas, wandering Prince of Troy</i>.
It is here given from that MS. collated with two different
printed copies, both in black-letter, in the Pepys Collection.</p>

<p>The reader will smile to observe with what natural and affecting
simplicity, our ancient ballad-maker has engrafted a Gothic conclusion
on the classic story of Virgil, from whom, however, it is
probable he had it not. Nor can it be denied, but he has dealt
out his poetical justice with a more impartial hand, than that
celebrated poet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This once popular ballad was entered on the Registers of the
Stationers Company in 1564-5 as "a ballett intituled <i>The Wanderynge</i>
<i>Prince</i>." Its great popularity is evidenced by the frequent references
in literature and the large number of ballads sung to the
tune of <i>Queen Dido</i> or <i>Troy towne</i>. In <i>The Penniless Parliament of</i>
<i>Threadbare Poets</i>, 1608, ale-knights are said to "sing <i>Queen Dido</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>over a cup and tell strange news over an ale-pot," and the same
song is referred to in Fletcher's <i>Captain</i> (act iii. sc. 3) and his
<i>Bonduca</i>, act i. sc. 2.</p>

<p>The only tune that Mr. Chappell could find for the ballad was
one by Dr. John Wilson (the Jack Wilson of Shakspere's stage
according to Dr. Rimbault), which is printed in his <i>Cheerful Ayres</i>
<i>or Ballads</i>, Oxford, 1660.]</p></div>

THE WITCHES' SONG</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i196.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">From</span> Ben Jonson's <i>Masque of Queens</i> presented at
Whitehall, Feb. 2, 1609.</p>

<p>The editor thought it incumbent on him to insert
some old pieces on the popular superstition concerning
witches, hobgoblins, fairies, and ghosts. The last of these make
their appearance in most of the tragical ballads; and in the following
songs will be found some description of the former.</p>

<p>It is true, this song of the Witches, falling from the learned pen
of Ben Jonson, is rather an extract from the various incantations
of classical antiquity, than a display of the opinions of our own
vulgar. But let it be observed, that a parcel of learned wiseacres
had just before busied themselves on this subject, in compliment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to K. James I. whose weakness on this head is well known: and
these had so ransacked all writers, ancient and modern, and so
blended and kneaded together the several superstitions of different
times and nations, that those of genuine English growth could no
longer be traced out and distinguished.</p>

<p>By good luck the whimsical belief of fairies and goblins could
furnish no pretences for torturing our fellow-creatures, and therefore
we have this handed down to us pure and unsophisticated.</p>

ROBIN GOOD-FELLOW,</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i199.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Alias</span> <i>Pucke</i>, alias <i>Hobgoblin</i>, in the creed of ancient
superstition, was a kind of merry sprite, whose character
and atchievements are recorded in this ballad, and in
those well-known lines of Milton's <i>L'Allegro</i>, which the
antiquarian Peck supposes to be owing to it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tells how the drudging <i>Goblin</i> swet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To earn his creame-bowle duly set;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in one night ere glimpse of morne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ten day-labourers could not end;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then lies him down the lubber fiend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretch'd out all the chimneys length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Basks at the fire his hairy strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crop-full out of doors he flings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the first cock his matins rings."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The reader will observe that our simple ancestors had reduced
all these whimsies to a kind of system, as regular, and perhaps
more consistent, than many parts of classic mythology: a proof of
the extensive influence and vast antiquity of these superstitions.
Mankind, and especially the common people, could not every
where have been so unanimously agreed concerning these arbitrary
notions, if they had not prevailed among them for many
ages. Indeed, a learned friend in Wales assures the Editor, that
the existence of Fairies and Goblins is alluded to by the most
ancient British Bards, who mention them under various names,
one of the most common of which signifies, <i>The spirits of the</i>
<i>mountains</i>. See also Preface to Song XXV.</p>

<p>This song, which Peck attributes to Ben Jonson, (tho' it is not
found among his works) is chiefly printed from an ancient black-letter
copy in the British Museum. It seems to have been originally
intended for some Masque.</p>

<p>It is intitled, in the old black-letter copies, <i>The mad merry</i>
<i>Prankes of Robin Goodfellow</i>. To the tune of <i>Dulcina</i>, &amp;c. (See
No. XIII. above.)</p>

<p>To one, if not more of the old copies, are prefixed two wooden
cuts, said to be taken from Bulwer's <i>Artificial Changeling, &amp;c.</i>,
which, as they seem to correspond with the notions then entertained
of the whimsical appearances of this fantastic spirit, and
perhaps were copied in the dresses in which he was formerly exhibited
on the stage, are, to gratify the curious, engraven below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The copy in the Roxburghe <i>Collection</i> (ed. Chappell, vol. ii.
pl. i. p. 80) is printed by H[enry] G[osson], who was a contemporary
of Ben Jonson. Some little books in prose on <i>Robin Goodfellow</i>,
written in the seventeenth century, were printed for the
Percy Society by Mr. J. P. Collier.]</p></div>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">We</span> have here a short display of the popular belief concerning
<i>Fairies</i>. It will afford entertainment to a contemplative
mind to trace these whimsical opinions up
to their origin. Whoever considers, how early, how
extensively, and how uniformly, they have prevailed in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>nations, will not readily assent to the hypothesis of those, who
fetch them from the east so late as the time of the Croisades.
Whereas it is well known that our Saxon ancestors, long before
they left their German forests, believed the existence of a kind of
diminutive demons, or middle species between men and spirits,
whom they called <i>Duergar</i> or <i>Dwarfs</i>, and to whom they attributed
many wonderful performances, far exceeding human art.

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> humorous old song fell from the hand of the witty
Dr. <i>Corbet</i> (afterwards bishop of Norwich, &amp;c.) and is
printed from his <i>Po&euml;tica Stromata</i>, 1648, 12mo. (compared
with the third edition of his poems, 1672.) It
is there called, <i>A proper new Ballad, intitled, The Fairies Farewell,</i>
<i>or God-a-mercy Will, to be sung or whistled to the tune of The Meddow</i>
<i>brow, by the learned; by the unlearned, to the tune of Fortune</i>.</p>

<p>The departure of Fairies is here attributed to the abolition of
monkery: Chaucer has, with equal humour, assigned a cause the
very reverse, in his <i>Wife of Bath's Tale</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8258; After these <i>Songs</i> on the <i>Fairies</i>, the reader may be curious
to see the manner in which they were formerly invoked and bound
to human service. In Ashmole's <i>Collection of MSS.</i> at Oxford
(Num. 8259. 1406. 2), are the papers of some alchymist, which
contain a variety of Incantations and Forms of Conjuring both
<i>Fairies</i>, <i>Witches</i>, and <i>Demons</i>, principally, as it should seem, to
assist him in his Great Work of transmuting Metals. Most of
them are too impious to be reprinted: but the two following may
be very innocently laughed at.</p>

<p>Whoever looks into Ben Jonson's <i>Alchymist</i>, will find that these
impostors, among their other secrets, affected to have a power over
<i>Fairies</i>: and that they were commonly expected to be seen in a
christal glass appears from that extraordinary book, <i>The Relation</i>
<i>of Dr. John Dee's actions with Spirits</i>, 1659, folio.</p>

<p><i>"An excellent way</i> to gett a <i>Fayrie</i>. (For myself I call <i>Margarett</i>
<i>Barrance</i>; but this will obteine any one that is not allready
bownd.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"First, gett a broad square christall or Venice glasse, in length
and breadth 3 inches. Then lay that glasse or christall in the
bloud of a white henne, 3 Wednesdayes, or 3 Fridayes. Then
take it out, and wash it with holy aq. and fumigate it. Then take
3 hazle sticks, or wands of an yeare groth: pill them fayre and
white; and make 'them' soe longe, as you write the <i>Spiritts</i>
name, or <i>Fayries</i> name, which you call, 3 times on every sticke
being made flatt on one side. Then bury them under some
hill, whereas you suppose <i>Fayries</i> haunt, the Wednesday before
you call her: and the Friday followinge take them uppe, and call
her at 8 or 3 or 10 of the clocke, which be good planetts and
houres for that turne: but when you call, be in cleane life, and
turne thy face towards the east. And when you have her, bind
her to that stone or glasse."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"An Unguent to annoynt under the Eyelids, and upon the
Eyelids eveninge and morninge: but especially when you call;
or find your sight not perfect.</p></div>



<p>"R. A pint of sallet-oyle, and put it into a viall glasse: but
first wash it with rose-water, and marygold-water; the flowers 'to'
be gathered towards the east. Wash it till the oyle come white;
then put it into the glasse, <i>ut supra</i>: and then put thereto the
budds of holyhocke, the flowers of marygold, the flowers or toppes
of wild thime, the budds of young hazle: and the thime must be
gathered neare the side of a hill where <i>Fayries</i> use to be: and
'take' the grasse of a fayrie throne, there. All these put into the
oyle, into the glasse: and set it to dissolve 3 dayes in the sunne,
and then keep it for thy use; <i>ut supra</i>."</p>

<p>After this receipt for the unguent follows a form of incantation,
wherein the alchymist conjures a fairy, named <i>Elaby Gathon</i>, to
appear to him in that chrystal glass, meekly and mildly; to resolve
him truly in all manner of questions; and to be obedient to all his
commands, under pain of damnation, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One of the vulgar opinions about fairies is, that they cannot be
seen by human eyes, without a particular charm exerted in favour
of the person who is to see them: and that they strike with blindness
such as having the gift of seeing them, take notice of them
<i>mal-&agrave;-propos</i>.</p>

<p>As to the hazle sticks mentioned above, they were to be probably
of that species called the <i>witch hazle</i>; which received its
name from this manner of applying it in incantations.</p></div>

<i>and the Dragon</i>, are chiefly taken from the old story-book
of the Seven Champions of Christendome; which,
tho' now the play-thing of children, was once in high
repute. Bp. Hall in his <i>Satires</i>, published in 1597, ranks</p>

<p class="center">"St. George's sorell, and his cross of blood,"
</p>

<p>among the most popular stories of his time: and an ingenious
critic thinks that Spencer himself did not disdain to borrow hints
from it;<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> tho' I much doubt whether this popular romance were
written so early as the <i>Faery Queen</i>.</p>

<p>The author of this book of the <i>Seven Champions</i> was one Richard
Johnson, who lived in the reigns of Elizabeth and James, as we
collect from his other publications: viz.&mdash;<i>The nine worthies of</i>
<i>London</i>: 1592, 4to.&mdash;<i>The pleasant walks of Moor fields</i>: 1607,
4to.&mdash;<i>A crown garland of Goulden Roses, gathered, &amp;c.</i> 1612, 8vo.&mdash;<i>The</i>
<i>life and death of Rob. Cecill, E. of Salisbury</i>: 1612, 4to.&mdash;<i>The</i>
<i>Hist. of Tom of Lincoln</i>, 4to. is also by R. J. who likewise
reprinted <i>Don Flores of Greece</i>, 4to.</p>

<p>The <i>Seven Champions</i>, tho' written in a wild inflated style, contains
some strong Gothic painting; which seems, for the most
part, copied from the metrical romances of former ages. At least
the story of <i>St. George and the fair Sabra</i> is taken almost verbatim
from the old poetical legend of <i>Syr Bevis of Hampton</i>.</p>

<p>This very antique poem was in great fame in Chaucer's time
(see above, pag. 107.), and so continued till the introduction of
printing, when it ran thro' several editions; two of which are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>black letter, 4to. "imprinted by Wyllyam Copland," without date;
containing great variations.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the poetic powers of this very old rhimist, and
as a proof how closely the author of the <i>Seven Champions</i> has followed
him, take a description of the dragon slain by sir Bevis.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;Whan the dragon, that foule is,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And smote syr Bevis with his tayle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then downe went horse and man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two rybbes of Bevis brused than."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After a long fight, at length, as the dragon was preparing to fly,
sir Bevis</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hit him under the wynge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he was in his flyenge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he was tender without scale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Bevis thought to be his bale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smote after, as I you saye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his good sword Morglaye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the hiltes Morglay yode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through harte, lyver, bone, and bloude:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the ground fell the dragon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great joye syr Bevis begon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the scales al on hight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smote off his head forth right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put it on a spere: &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="stageright">Sign. K. iv.</p>

<p>Sir Bevis's dragon is evidently the parent of that in the <i>Seven</i>
<i>Champions</i>, see chap, iii., viz. "The dragon no sooner had a sight
of him (St. George) but he gave such a terrible peal, as though it
had thundered in the elements.... Betwixt his shoulders and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
tail were fifty feet in distance, his scales glistering as bright as
silver, but far more hard than brass; his belly of the colour of
gold, but bigger than a tun. Thus weltered he from his den, &amp;c....
The champion ... gave the dragon such a thrust with his
spear, that it shivered in a thousand pieces: whereat the furious
dragon so fiercely smote him with his venomous tail, that down
fell man and horse: in which fall two of St. George's ribs were so
bruised, &amp;c.&mdash;At length ... St. George smote the dragon under
the wing where it was tender without scale, whereby his good
sword Ascalon with an easie passage went to the very hilt through
both the dragon's heart, liver, bone, and blood.&mdash;Then St. George&mdash;cut
off the dragon's head and pitcht it upon the truncheon of a
spear, &amp;c."</p>

<p>The <i>History of the Seven Champions</i>, being written just before
the decline of books of chivalry, was never, I believe, translated
into any foreign language: But <i>Le Roman de Beuves of Hantonne</i>
was published at Paris in 1502, 4to. Let. Gothique.</p>

<p>The learned Selden tell us, that about the time of the Norman
invasion was Bevis famous with the title of Earl of Southampton,
whose residence was at Duncton in Wiltshire; but he observes,
that the monkish enlargements of his story have made his very
existence doubted. See <i>Notes on Poly-Olbion, Song</i> iii.</p>

<p>This hath also been the case of <i>St. George</i> himself; whose
martial history is allowed to be apocryphal. But, to prove that
there really existed an orthodox saint of this name (altho' little or
nothing, it seems, is known of his genuine story) is the subject of
<i>An Historical and Critical Inquiry into the Existence and Character</i>
<i>of St. George, &amp;c.</i> By the Rev. J. Milner, F.S.A. 1792, 8vo.</p>

<p>The equestrian figure worn by the Knights of the Garter, has
been understood to be an emblem of the Christian warrior, in his
spiritual armour, vanquishing the old serpent.</p>

<p>But on this subject the inquisitive reader may consult <i>A Dissertation</i>
<i>on the Original of the Equestrian Figure of the George and of</i>
<i>the Garter, ensigns of the most noble order of that name</i>. Illustrated
with copper-plates. By John Petingal, A.M., Fellow of the Society
of Antiquaries, London, 1753, 4to. This learned and curious work
the author of the <i>Historical and Critical Inquiry</i> would have done
well to have seen.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied, but that the following ballad is for the
most part modern: for which reason it would have been thrown
to the end of the volume, had not its subject procured it a place
here.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> excellent song is ancient: but we could only give
it from a modern copy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Earlier editions of this spirited song are printed in
Evans's <i>Old Ballads</i>, iii. 282 (1810), and Rimbault's <i>Little Book</i>
<i>of Songs and Ballads</i>, p. 137. It is quoted in Brome's <i>Sparagus</i>
<i>Garden</i>, acted in 1635, and Shirley's <i>Constant Maid</i> was republished
in 1661, under the title of <i>Love will find out the Way</i>, by T. B.</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault has the following note in his <i>Musical Illustrations</i>,
"The old black-letter copy of this ballad is called '<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span><i>Truth's Integrity:</i>
<i>or, a curious Northerne Ditty</i>, called <i>Love will finde out the Way</i>. To
a pleasant new Tune Printed at London for F. Coules, dwelling in
the Old Bailey.' There is a second part consisting of six stanzas,
which Percy has not reprinted. The tune is here given (translated
from the <i>Tablature</i>) from <i>Musicks Recreation on the Lyra Viol</i>, published
by Playford in 1652. It is also preserved in Forbes's <i>Cantus</i>,
1662; in <i>Musick's Delight on the Cithren</i>, 1666; and in D'Urfey's
<i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>, 1719. The <i>Pepysian Collection</i> contains
several ballads to this tune."</p>

<p>Mr. Chappell writes, "The air is still current, for in the summer
of 1855, Mr. Jennings, Organist of All Saints' Church, Maidstone,
noted it down from the wandering hop-pickers singing a song to
it on their entrance into that town." <i>Popular Music</i>, vol. i.
p. 304.]</p></div>

from the recitation of Mrs. W. Arrot of Aberbrothick, and is entitled

volume of "<i>Poems</i> by <i>Thomas Carew</i>, Esq. one of the
gentlemen of the privie-chamber, and sewer in ordinary

<h3>VI.<br />

GEORGE BARNWELL.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i240.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this ballad is sufficiently popular from
the modern play which is founded upon it. This was
written by <i>George Lillo</i>, a jeweller of London, and first
acted about 1730.&mdash;As for the ballad it was printed at
least as early as the middle of the last century.</p>

<p>It is here given from three old printed copies, which exhibit a
strange intermixture of Roman and black letter. It is also collated
with another copy in the <i>Ashmole Collection</i> at Oxford,
which is thus intitled, "An excellent ballad of <i>George Barnwell</i>, an
apprentice of London, who ... thrice robbed his master and murdered
his uncle in Ludlow." The tune is <i>The Merchant</i>.</p>

<p>This tragical narrative seems to relate a real fact; but when it
happened I have not been able to discover.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Ritson writes as follows concerning certain improvements made
by Percy in the following ballad (<i>Ancient Songs</i>, 1829, vol. ii. p. 165,
note):&mdash;"Throughout this 'second part' (except in a single instance)
the metre of the first line of each stanza is in the old
editions lengthened by a couple of syllables, which are, occasionally
at least, a manifest interpolation. The person also is
for the most part changed from the first to the third, with evident
impropriety. Dr. Percy has very ingeniously restored the measure
by ejecting the superfluous syllables, and given consistency to the
whole by the restoration of the proper person; and as it is now
highly improbable that any further ancient copy will be found, and
those which exist are manifestly corrupt, it seemed justifiable to
adopt the judicious emendations of this ingenious editor."</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault observes, "This curious tune (<i>The Merchant</i>)
which has been quite overlooked by antiquaries, is found, together
with the original ballad, <i>The Merchant and the Fiddler's Wife</i>, in
D'Urfey's <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>, vol. v. p. 77, edit. 1719."</p>

<p>The former great popularity of the story of the wicked young
prentice is shown by James Smith's parody in the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>
and Thackeray's caricature romance&mdash;<i>George de Barnwell</i>.]</p></div>

of whom some account was given in the former part of
this volume; see the song intitled, <i>The Shepherd's</i>
<i>Resolution</i>, book ii. song xxi. In the first edition of this
work only a small fragment of this sonnet was inserted. It was
afterwards rendered more compleat and intire by the addition of
five stanzas more, extracted from Wither's pastoral poem, intitled,
<i>The Mistress of Philarete</i>, of which this song makes a part. It is
now given still more correct and perfect by comparing it with
another copy, printed by the author in his improved edition of
<i>The Shepherd's Hunting</i>, 1620, 8vo.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> old story-book of <i>Valentine and Orson</i> (which suggested
the plan of this tale, but it is not strictly followed
in it) was originally a translation from the
French, being one of their earliest attempts at romance.
See <i>Le Biblioth&egrave;que de Romans, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The circumstance of the bridge of bells is taken from the old
metrical legend of Sir Bevis, and has also been copied in the
<i>Seven Champions</i>. The original lines are,</p>

<p>In the Editor's folio MS. was an old poem on this subject, in a
wretched corrupt state, unworthy the press: from which were
taken such particulars as could be adopted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are no particular signs of "corruption," and the piece is
probably superior to Percy's own effusion.</p>

<p>Percy's trumpery commencement is an echo of the beginning
of the printed copies of <i>Sir Andrew Barton</i>.</p>

<p>The name Ursine, like that of Orson, is derived from Fr. <i>Ourson</i>,
the diminutive of <i>Ours</i>, a bear (Latin, <i>ursus</i>.)]</p></div>

THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i279.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> humourous song (as a former Editor<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> has well observed)
is to old metrical romances and ballads of
chivalry, what <i>Don Quixote</i> is to prose narratives of
that kind:&mdash;a lively satire on their extravagant fictions.
But altho' the satire is thus general, the subject of this ballad is
local and peculiar: so that many of the finest strokes of humour
are lost for want of our knowing the minute circumstances to
which they allude. Many of them can hardly now be recovered,
altho' we have been fortunate enough to learn the general subject
to which the satire referred, and shall detail the information, with
which we have been favoured, at the end of this introduction.</p>

<p>In handling his subject, the Author has brought in most of
the common incidents which occur in romance. The description
of the dragon<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>&mdash;his outrages&mdash;the people flying to the knight
for succour&mdash;his care in chusing his armour&mdash;his being drest for
fight by a young damsel&mdash;and most of the circumstances of the
battle and victory (allowing for the burlesque turn given to them)
are what occur in every book of chivalry, whether in prose or
verse.</p>

<p>If any one piece, more than other, is more particularly levelled
at, it seems to be the old rhiming legend of sir Bevis. There a
<i>Dragon</i> is attacked from a <i>Well</i> in a manner not very remote from
this of the ballad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a well, so have I wynne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Bevis stumbled ryght therein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than was he glad without fayle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rested a whyle for his avayle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dranke of that water his fyll;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And then he lepte out, with good wyll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with Morglay his brande<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He assayled the dragon, I understande:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the dragon he smote so faste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where that he hit the scales braste:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dragon then faynted sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast a galon and more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of his mouthe of venim strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on syr Bevis he it flong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was venymous y-wis.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This seems to be meant by the Dragon of Wantley's stink,
ver. 110. As the politick knight's creeping out, and attacking the
dragon, &amp;c. seems evidently to allude to the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bevis blessed himselfe and forth yode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lepte out with haste full good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Bevis unto the dragon gone is;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dragon also to Bevis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longe, and harde was that fyght<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwene the dragon, and that knyght:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever whan syr Bevis was hurt sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He went to the well, and washed him thore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was as hole as any man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever freshe as whan he began.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dragon sawe it might not avayle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besyde the well to hold batayle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought he would, wyth some wyle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of that place Bevis begyle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He woulde have flowen then awaye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Bevis lepte after with good Morglaye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hyt him under the wynge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he was in his flyenge, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="stageright">Sign. M. jv. L. j. &amp;c.</p>

<p>After all, perhaps the writer of this ballad was acquainted with
the above incidents only thro' the medium of Spenser, who has
assumed most of them in his <i>Faery Queen</i>. At least some particulars
in the description of the Dragon, &amp;c. seem evidently borrowed
from the latter. See book i. canto 11, where the Dragon's
"two wynges like sayls&mdash;huge long tayl&mdash;with stings&mdash;his cruel
rending clawes&mdash;and yron teeth&mdash;his breath of smothering smoke
and sulphur"&mdash;and the duration of the fight for upwards of two
days, bear a great resemblance to passages in the following ballad;
though it must be confessed that these particulars are common to
all old writers of romance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Altho' this ballad must have been written early in the last
century, we have met with none but such as were comparatively
modern copies. It is here printed from one in Roman letter,
in the Pepys collection, collated with such others as could be
procured.</p>

<p>A description of the supposed scene of this ballad, which was
communicated to the Editor in 1767, is here given in the words
of the relater:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Yorkshire, 6 miles from Rotherham, is a village, called
<i>Wortley</i>, the seat of the late <i>Wortley Montague</i>, Esq. About a
mile from this village is a lodge, named <i>Warncliff Lodge</i>, but
vulgarly called <i>Wantley</i>: here lies the scene of the song. I was
there about forty years ago: and it being a woody rocky place,
my friend made me clamber over rocks and stones, not telling me
to what end, till I came to a sort of a cave; then asked my
opinion of the place, and pointing to one end, says, Here lay the
dragon killed by <i>Moor</i> of <i>Moor-hall</i>: here lay his head; here
lay his tail; and the stones we came over on the hill, are those he
could not crack; and yon white house you see half a mile off, is
<i>Moor-hall</i>. I had dined at the lodge, and knew the man's name
was <i>Matthew</i>, who was a keeper to Mr. Wortley, and, as he endeavoured
to persuade me, was the same Matthew mentioned in
the song: In the house is the picture of the Dragon and Moor of
Moor-hall, and near it a well, which, says he, is the well described
in the ballad."</p>

<p>Since the former editions of this humorous old song were printed,
the following <i>Key to the Satire</i> hath been communicated by <i>Godfrey</i>
<i>Bosville</i>, Esq. of Thorp, near Malton, in Yorkshire; who, in
the most obliging manner, gave full permission to adjoin it to the
poem.</p>

<p><i>Warncliffe</i> Lodge, and <i>Warncliffe</i> Wood (vulgarly pronounced
<i>Wantley</i>), are in the parish of Penniston, in Yorkshire. The
rectory of Penniston was part of the dissolved monastery of
St. Stephen's, Westminster; and was granted to the Duke of
Norfolk's family: who therewith endowed an hospital, which he
built at Sheffield, for women. The trustees let the impropriation
of the great Tythes of Penniston to the Wortley family, who got a
great deal by it, and wanted to get still more; for Mr. Nicholas
Wortley attempted to take the tythes in kind, but Mr. Francis
Bosville opposed him, and there was a decree in favour of the
Modus in 37th Eliz. The vicarage of Penniston did not go along
with the rectory, but with the copyhold rents, and was part of a
large purchase made by Ralph Bosville, Esq. from Q. Elizabeth,
in the 2d year of her reign: and that part he sold in 12th Eliz. to
his elder brother Godfrey, the father of Francis; who left it, with
the rest of his estate, to his wife, for her life, and then to Ralph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
3d son of his uncle Ralph. The widow married Lyonel Rowlestone,
lived eighteen years, and survived Ralph.</p>

<p>This premised, the ballad apparently relates to the law-suit
carried on concerning this claim of tythes made by the Wortley
family. "Houses and churches, were to him geese and turkeys:"
which are tytheable things, the dragon chose to live on. Sir
Francis Wortley, the son of Nicholas, attempted again to take
the tythes in kind: but the parishioners subscribed an agreement
to defend their Modus. And at the head of the agreement was
Lyonel Rowlestone, who is supposed to be one of "the Stones,
dear Jack, which the Dragon could not crack." The agreement
is still preserved in a large sheet of parchment, dated 1st of James I.,
and is full of names and seals, which might be meant by the coat
of armour, "with spikes all about, both within and without."
<i>More</i> of <i>More-hall</i> was either the attorney, or counsellor, who
conducted the suit. He is not distinctly remembered, but More-hall
is still extant at the very bottom of Wantley [Warncliff]
Wood, and lies so low, that it might be said to be in a well: as
the dragon's den [Warncliff Lodge] was at the top of the wood,
"with Matthew's house hard by it." The keepers belonging to
the Wortley family were named, for many generations, Matthew
Northall: the last of them left this lodge, within memory, to be
keeper to the Duke of Norfolk. The present owner of More-hall
still attends Mr. Bosville's Manor-Court at Oxspring, and pays a
rose a year. "More of More-hall, with nothing at all, slew the
Dragon of Wantley." He gave him, instead of tythes, so small a
Modus, that it was in effect nothing at all, and was slaying him
with a vengeance. "The poor children three," &amp;c. cannot surely
mean the three sisters of Francis Bosville, who would have been
coheiresses, had he made no will? The late Mr. Bosville had a
contest with the descendants of two of them, the late Sir Geo.
Saville's father, and Mr. Copley, about the presentation to Penniston,
they supposing Francis had not the power to give this part
of the estate from the heirs at law; but it was decided against
them. The dragon (Sir Francis Wortley) succeeded better with
his cousin Wordesworth, the freehold lord of the manor (for it is
the copyhold manor that belongs to Mr. Bosville) having persuaded
him not to join the refractory parishioners, under a promise
that he would let him his tythes cheap: and now the estates
of Wortley and Wordesworth are the only lands that pay tythes in
the parish.</p>

<p>N.B. "Two days and a night," mentioned in ver. 125, as the
duration of the combat, was probably that of the trial at law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In Gough's edition of Camden's <i>Britannia</i> we learn that "Sir
Thomas Wortley, who was knight of the body to Edward IV.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Richard III., Henry VII. and VIII., built a lodge in his chace
of Warncliffe, and had a house and park there, disparked in the
Civil War."</p>

<p>Mr. Gilfillan has the following note in his edition of the <i>Reliques</i>,
"A legend current in the Wortley family states the dragon to have
been a formidable drinker, drunk dead by the chieftain of the opposite
moors. Ellis thinks it was a wolf or some other fierce animal
hunted down by More of More-hall." A writer in the <i>Notes and</i>
<i>Queries</i> (3rd S. ix. 29), who signs himself "Fitzhopkins," expresses
his disbelief in the above explanation communicated to Percy by
Godfrey Bosville.]</p></div>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">As</span> the former song is in ridicule of the extravagant incidents
in old ballads and metrical romances; so this is
a burlesque of their style; particularly of the rambling
transitions and wild accumulations of unconnected
parts, so frequent in many of them.</p>

<p>This ballad is given from an old black-letter copy in the Pepys
collection, "imprinted at London, 1612." It is more ancient
than many of the preceding; but we place it here for the sake
of connecting it with the <i>Second Part</i>.</p>

<p>[<i>Saint George that, O! did break the dragon's heart</i> is one of the
ballads offered for sale by Nightingale, the ballad-singer in Ben
Jonson's comedy of <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> (act ii. sc. 1), and according
to Fielding's Tom Jones, <i>St. George, he was for England</i>, was one
of Squire Western's favourite tunes.</p>

<p>This ballad is printed in several collections, and Mr. Chappell
notices a modernization subscribed S. S. and "printed for W.
Gilbertson in Giltspur Street," about 1659, which commences&mdash;</p>

Oxford. The occasion of its being composed is said
to have been as follows. A set of gentlemen of the
university had formed themselves into a club, all the
members of which were to be of the name of <i>George</i>: Their anniversary
feast was to be held on <i>St. George's</i> day. Our author
solicited strongly to be admitted; but his name being unfortunately
<i>John</i>, this disqualification was dispensed with only upon this condition,
that he would compose a song in honour of their Patron
Saint, and would every year produce one or more new stanzas,

<p><i>John Grubb</i>, the facetious writer of the foregoing song, makes a
distinguished figure among the Oxford wits so humorously enumerated
in the following distich:</p>

<span class="i0">Bub, Stubb, Grubb, Crabb, Trap, Young, Carey, Tickel, Evans.<br /></span>

<p>These were Bub Dodington (the late lord Melcombe), Dr. Stubbes,
our poet <i>Grubb</i>, Mr. Crabb, Dr. Trapp the poetry-professor, Dr.
Edw. Young, the author of Night-Thoughts, Walter Carey, Thomas
Tickel, Esq., and Dr. Evans the epigrammatist.</p>

<p>As for our poet <i>Grubb</i>, all that we can learn further of him is
contained in a few extracts from the University Register, and from
his epitaph. It appears from the former that he was matriculated
in 1667, being the son of John Grubb, "<i>de Acton Burnel in</i>
<i>comitatu Salop. pauperis</i>." He took his degree of Bachelor of Arts,
June 28, 1671: and became Master of Arts, June 28, 1675. He
was appointed Head Master of the Grammar School at Christ
Church: and afterwards chosen into the same employment at
Gloucester, where he died in 1697, as appears from his monument
in the church of St. Mary de Crypt in Gloucester, which is inscribed
with the following epitaph:&mdash;</p>

MARGARET'S GHOST.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i308.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> ballad, which appeared in some of the public newspapers
in or before the year 1724, came from the pen
of David Mallet, Esq. who in the edition of his poems,
3 vols. 1759, informs us that the plan was suggested
by the four verses quoted above in page <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, which he supposed
to be the beginning of some ballad now lost.</p>

<p>"These lines, says he, naked of ornament and simple, as they
are, struck my fancy; and bringing fresh into my mind an unhappy
adventure much talked of formerly, gave birth to the following
poem, which was written many years ago."</p>

<p>The two introductory lines (and one or two others elsewhere)
had originally more of the ballad simplicity, viz.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When all was wrapt in dark midnight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all were fast asleep," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a late publication, intitled, <i>The Friends</i>, &amp;c. Lond. 1773,
2 vols. 12mo. (in the first volume, p. 71) is inserted a copy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the foregoing ballad, with very great variations, which the editor
of that work contends was the original; and that Mallet adopted
it for his own and altered it, as here given.&mdash;But the superior
beauty and simplicity of the present copy, gives it so much more
the air of an original, that it will rather be believed that some
transcriber altered it from Mallet's, and adapted the lines to his
own taste; than which nothing is more common in popular songs
and ballads.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This ballad, more generally known as <i>William and Margaret</i>,
is supposed to have been printed for the first time in Aaron Hill's
<i>Plain Dealer</i> (No. 36, July 24, 1724), when the author was a very
young man. Hill introduced it to the reader as the work of an
old poet, and wrote, "I am sorry I am not able to acquaint my
readers with his name to whom we owe this melancholy piece of
finished poetry under the humble title of a ballad." In the following
month the editor announced that "he had discovered the
author to be still alive." The verses were probably written in
1723, in the August of which year Mallet left Scotland, for Allan
Ramsay, in his <i>Stanzas to Mr. David Mallock on his departure from</i>
<i>Scotland</i>, alludes to them:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But he that could, in tender strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Raise Margaret's plaining shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paints distress that chills the veins,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While William's crimes are red."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ballad at once became popular, and was printed in several
collections, undergoing many alterations for the worse by the
way. Sundry attempts were made to rob Mallet of the credit of
his song. Besides the one mentioned above by Percy, Captain
Thompson, the editor of Andrew Marvell's Works, claimed it for
Marvell, but this claim was even more ridiculous than those he
set up against Addison and Watts. Although Mallet doubtless
knew the ballads <i>Fair Margaret and Sweet William</i> (book ii.
No. 4) and <i>Sweet William's Ghost</i> (No. 6), he is said to have
founded his own upon a true story which came under his observation.
A daughter of Professor James Gregory of St. Andrews,
and afterwards of Edinburgh, was seduced by a son of Sir William
Sharp of Strathyrum, who had promised to marry her, but heartlessly
deserted her.</p>

<p>The ballad has been extravagantly praised: Ritson observes,
"It may be questioned whether any English writer has produced
so fine a ballad as <i>William and Margaret</i>." Percy describes it as
one of the most beautiful ballads in our own or any other language;
and Allan Ramsay writes, "I know not where to seek a finer
mixture of pathos and terror in the whole range of Gothic romance."
Scott, on the other hand, was of opinion that "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
ballad, though the best of Mallet's writing, is certainly inferior to
the original, which I presume to be the very fine and terrific old
Scottish tale, beginning</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There came a ghost to Margaret's door.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The extreme popularity of the poem is seen by the various parodies,
one of which, <i>Watty and Madge</i>, is printed in Ramsay's <i>Tea</i>
<i>Table Miscellany</i> (vol. iii.). It commences&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas at the shining mid-day hour,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>and each succeeding verse is parodied in the same manner. Vincent
Browne imitated the original in Latin verse, and a German
version was published as <i>Wilhelm und Gretchen</i>.</p>

<p>Mallet was a native of Crieff in Perthshire, and is believed to
have been born in the year 1702. He was sometime tutor to the
Montrose family, through whose influence he was introduced into
public life. He changed his name from Malloch to Mallet when
he settled in London, and in 1742 he was appointed Under Secretary
to the Prince of Wales. He died on the 21st of April, 1765.
Mallet is a writer little cared for now, but he can hardly be said
to be neglected, for in 1857 Mr. Frederick Dinsdale published an
illustrated edition of his Ballads and Songs, chiefly made up of
copious notes on <i>William and Margaret</i> and <i>Edwin and Emma</i>.]</p></div>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/i312.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Was</span> written by Thomas Tickell, Esq. the celebrated friend
of Mr. Addison, and editor of his works. He was son
of a clergyman in the north of England, had his education
at Queen's college, Oxon, was under secretary to
Mr. Addison and Mr. Craggs, when successively secretaries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
state; and was lastly (in June, 1724) appointed secretary to the
Lords Justices in Ireland, which place he held till his death in
1740.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> He acquired Mr. Addison's patronage by a poem in praise
of the opera of <i>Rosamond</i>, written while he was at the University.</p>

<p>It is a tradition in Ireland, that the song was written at Castletown,
in the county of Kildare, at the request of the then Mrs.
Conolly&mdash;probably on some event recent in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>[Gray called <i>Lucy and Colin</i> "the prettiest" ballad in the world,
although he was not partial to Tickell's other poems.</p>

<p>The fine old melody given by Dr. Rimbault for this ballad is
taken from "<i>The Merry Musician; or a Cure for the Spleen</i>; being
a collection of the most diverting Songs and pleasant Ballads
set to Musick," 1716.]</p>

curious <i>M&eacute;moires sur l'ancienne Chevalerie</i>, Paris, 1759, 2 tom.
12mo., who tells us the story resembles that of Ariosto's inchanted
cup. 'Tis possible our English poet may have taken the hint of
this subject from that old French romance, but he does not appear
to have copied it in the manner of execution; to which (if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
may judge from the specimen given in the <i>M&eacute;moires</i>) that of the
ballad does not bear the least resemblance. After all, 'tis most
likely that all the old stories concerning K. Arthur are originally
of British growth, and that what the French and other southern
nations have of this kind, were at first exported from this island.
See <i>M&eacute;moires de l'Acad. des Inscrip.</i> tom. xx. p. 352.</p>

<p>(Since this volume was printed off, the <i>Fabliaux ou Contes</i>, 1781,
5 tom. 12mo., of <i>M. le Grand</i>, have come to hand: and in tom. i.
p. 54, he hath printed a modern version of the old tale <i>Le Court</i>
<i>Mantel</i>, under a new title <i>Le Manteau maltaill&eacute;</i>; which contains the
story of this ballad much enlarged, so far as regards the <i>Mantle</i>;
but without any mention of the <i>Knife</i>, or the <i>Horn</i>.)</p>

<p>&#8258; The Rev. Evan Evans, editor of the specimens of <i>Welsh</i>
<i>Poetry</i>, 4to. affirmed that the <i>Boy and the Mantle</i> is taken from
what is related in some of the old Welsh MSS. of Tegan Earfron,
one of King Arthur's mistresses. She is said to have possessed a
mantle that would not fit any immodest or incontinent woman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
this, (which, the old writers say, was reckoned among the curiosities
of Britain) is frequently alluded to by the old Welsh Bards.</p>

<p><i>Carleile</i>, so often mentioned in the ballads of K. Arthur, the
editor once thought might probably be a corruption of <i>Caer-leon</i>,
an ancient British city on the river Uske, in Monmouthshire, which
was one of the places of K. Arthur's chief residence; but he is
now convinced, that it is no other than <i>Carlisle</i>, in Cumberland;
the old English minstrels, being most of them northern men,
naturally represented the hero of romance as residing in the north:
And many of the places mentioned in the old ballads are still to
be found there: As <i>Tearne-Wadling</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Near Penrith is still seen a large circle, surrounded by a mound
of earth, which retains the name of Arthur's Round Table.</p>

as the home of King Arthur, see J. S. Stuart Glennie's

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> second poem in this volume, intitled <i>The Marriage</i>
<i>of Sir Gawaine</i>, having been offered to the reader with
large conjectural supplements and corrections, the old
fragment itself is here literally and exactly printed from
the editor's folio MS. with all its defects, inaccuracies, and errata;
that such austere antiquaries, as complain that the ancient copies
have not been always rigidly adhered to, may see how unfit for
publication many of the pieces would have been, if all the blunders,
corruptions, and nonsense of illiterate reciters and transcribers
had been superstitiously retained, without some attempt to correct
and emend them.</p>

<p>This ballad had most unfortunately suffered by having half of
every leaf in this part of the MS. torn away; and, as about nine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>stanzas generally occur in the half page now remaining, it is concluded,
that the other half contained nearly the same number of
stanzas.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> first attempts at composition among all
barbarous nations are ever found to be
poetry and song. The praises of their
gods, and the achievements of their heroes,
are usually chanted at their festival meetings. These
are the first rudiments of history. It is in this
manner that the savages of North America preserve
the memory of past events<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>; and the same method
is known to have prevailed among our Saxon ancestors
before they quitted their German forests<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>.
The ancient Britons had their Bards, and the Gothic
nations their Scalds or popular poets<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>, whose business
it was to record the victories of their warriors,
and the genealogies of their princes, in a kind of
narrative songs, which were committed to memory,
and delivered down from one reciter to another. So
long as poetry continued a distinct profession, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>while the Bard, or Scald, was a regular and stated
officer in the prince's court, these men are thought
to have performed the functions of the historian
pretty faithfully; for though their narrations would
be apt to receive a good deal of embellishment, they
are supposed to have had at the bottom so much of
truth as to serve for the basis of more regular annals.
At least succeeding historians have taken up with
the relations of these rude men, and for the want of
more authentic records, have agreed to allow them
the credit of true history<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>.</p>

<p>After letters began to prevail, and history assumed
a more stable form, by being committed to plain
simple prose; these songs of the Scalds or Bards
began to be more amusing than useful. And in proportion
as it became their business chiefly to entertain
and delight, they gave more and more into
embellishment, and set off their recitals with such
marvellous fictions, as were calculated to captivate
gross and ignorant minds. Thus began stories of
adventures with giants and dragons, and witches
and enchanters, and all the monstrous extravagances
of wild imagination, unguided by judgment, and
uncorrected by art<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>.</p>

<p>This seems to be the true origin of that species of
romance, which so long celebrated feats of chivalry,
and which at first in metre, and afterwards in prose,
was the entertainment of our ancestors, in common
with their contemporaries on the continent, till the
satire of Cervantes, or rather the increase of knowledge
and classical literature, drove them off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>stage to make room for a more refined species of
fiction, under the name of French Romances, copied
from the Greek<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>.</p>

<p>That our old romances of chivalry may be derived
in a lineal descent from the ancient historical songs
of the Gothic Bards and Scalds, will be shown below,
and indeed appears the more evident, as many of
those songs are still preserved in the north, which
exhibit all the seeds of chivalry before it became a
solemn institution<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>. "Chivalry, as a distinct military
order, conferred in the way of investiture, and
accompanied with the solemnity of an oath, and
other ceremonies," was of later date, and sprung out
of the feudal constitution, as an elegant writer has
clearly shown<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>. But the ideas of chivalry prevailed
long before in all the Gothic nations, and may
be discovered as in embriyo in the customs, manners,
and opinions of every branch of that people<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>.
That fondness of going in quest of adventures, that
spirit of challenging to single combat, and that respectful
complaisance shewn to the fair sex, (so
different from the manners of the Greeks and Romans),
all are of Gothic origin, and may be traced
up to the earliest times among all the northern
nations<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>. These existed long before the feudal
ages, though they were called forth and strengthened
in a peculiar manner under that constitution, and at
length arrived to their full maturity in the times
of the Crusades, so replete with romantic adventures<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the common arbitrary fictions of romance
were (as is hinted above) most of them familiar to the
ancient Scalds of the North, long before the time of
the Crusades. They believed the existence of giants
and dwarfs<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>; they entertained opinions not unlike
the more modern notion of fairies<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>, they were
strongly possessed with the belief of spells and inchantment<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>,
and were fond of inventing combats
with dragons and monsters<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>.</p>

<p>The opinion therefore seems very untenable, which
some learned and ingenious men have entertained,
that the turn for chivalry, and the taste for that species
of romantic fiction were caught by the Spaniards
from the Arabians or Moors after their invasion of
Spain, and from the Spaniards transmitted to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>bards of Armorica<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>, and thus diffused through
Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and the North.
For it seems utterly incredible, that one rude people
should adopt a peculiar taste and manner of writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>or thinking from another, without borrowing at the
same time any of their particular stories and fables,
without appearing to know anything of their heroes,
history, laws, and religion. When the Romans began
to adopt and imitate the Grecian literature, they
immediately naturalized all the Grecian fables, histories,
and religious stories; which became as familiar
to the poets of Rome, as of Greece itself. Whereas
all the old writers of chivalry, and of that species of
romance, whether in prose or verse, whether of the
Northern nations, or of Britain, France, and Italy,
not excepting Spain itself<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>, appear utterly unacquainted
with whatever relates to the Mahometan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>nations. Thus with regard to their religion, they
constantly represent them as worshipping idols, as
paying adoration to a golden image of Mahomet, or
else they confound them with the ancient pagans,
&amp;c. And indeed in all other respects they are so
grossly ignorant of the customs, manners, and
opinions of every branch of that people, especially of
their heroes, champions, and local stories, as almost
amounts to a demonstration that they did not imitate
them in their songs or romances: for as to dragons,
serpents, necromancies, &amp;c., why should these be
thought only derived from the Moors in Spain so
late as after the eighth century? since notions of
this kind appear too familiar to the northern Scalds
and enter too deeply into all the northern mythology,
to have been transmitted to the unlettered Scandinavians,
from so distant a country, at so late a
period. If they may not be allowed to have brought
these opinions with them in their original migrations
from the north of Asia, they will be far more likely
to have borrowed them from the Latin poets after the
Roman conquests in Gaul, Britain, Germany, &amp;c.
For, I believe one may challenge the maintainers
of this opinion, to produce any Arabian poem or
history, that could possibly have been then known in
Spain, which resembles the old Gothic romances of
chivalry half so much as the Metamorphoses of
Ovid.</p>

<p>But we well know that the Scythian nations situate
in the countries about Pontus, Colchis, and the
Euxine sea, were in all times infamous for their
magic arts: and as Odin and his followers are said
to have come precisely from those parts of Asia; we
can readily account for the prevalence of fictions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>this sort among the Gothic nations of the North,
without fetching them from the Moors in Spain;
who for many centuries after their irruption, lived in
a state of such constant hostility with the unsubdued
Spanish Christians, whom they chiefly pent up in the
mountains, as gave them no chance of learning their
music, poetry, or stories; and this, together with the
religious hatred of the latter for their cruel invaders,
will account for the utter ignorance of the old
Spanish romancers in whatever relates to the Mahometan
nations, although so nearly their own
neighbours.</p>

<p>On the other hand, from the local customs and
situations, from the known manners and opinions of
the Gothic nations in the north, we can easily account
for all the ideas of chivalry and its peculiar
fictions<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>. For, not to mention their distinguished
respect for the fair sex, so different from the manners
of the Mahometan nations<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>, their national and domestic
history so naturally assumes all the wonders
of this species of fabling, that almost all their historical
narratives appear regular romances. One might
refer in proof of this to the old northern Sagas in
general: but to give a particular instance it will be
sufficient to produce the history of King Regner
Lodbrog, a celebrated warrior and pirate, who reigned
in Denmark about the year 800<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>. This hero
signalized his youth by an exploit of gallantry. A
Swedish prince had a beautiful daughter whom he
intrusted (probably during some expedition) to the
care of one of his officers, assigning a strong castle
for their defence. The officer fell in love with his
ward, and detained her in his castle, spite of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>efforts of her father. Upon this he published a proclamation
through all the neighbouring countries,
that whoever would conquer the ravisher and rescue
the lady should have her in marriage. Of all that
undertook the adventure, Regner alone was so happy
as to achieve it: he delivered the fair captive, and
obtained her for his prize. It happened that the
name of this discourteous officer was Orme, which in
the Islandic language signifies serpent: Wherefore
the Scalds, to give the more poetical turn to the adventure,
represent the lady as detained from her
father by a dreadful dragon, and that Regner slew
the monster to set her at liberty. This fabulous
account of the exploit is given in a poem still extant,
which is even ascribed to Regner himself, who was a
celebrated poet; and which records all the valiant
achievements of his life<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.</p>

<p>With marvelous embellishments of this kind the
Scalds early began to decorate their narratives: and
they were the more lavish of these, in proportion as
they departed from their original institution, but it
was a long time before they thought of delivering a
set of personages and adventures wholly feigned.
Of the great multitude of romantic tales still preserved
in the libraries of the North, most of them
are supposed to have had some foundation in truth,
and the more ancient they are, the more they are
believed to be connected with true history<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>.</p>

<p>It was not probably till after the historian and the
bard had been long disunited, that the latter ventured
at pure fiction. At length when their business
was no longer to instruct or inform, but merely to
amuse, it was no longer needful for them to adhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>to truth. Then succeeded fabulous songs and romances
in verse, which for a long time prevailed in
France and England before they had books of chivalry
in prose. Yet in both these countries the
minstrels still retained so much of their original institution,
as frequently to make true events the subject
of their songs<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>; and indeed, as during the
barbarous ages, the regular histories were almost all
written in Latin by the monks, the memory of events
was preserved and propagated among the ignorant
laity by scarce any other means than the popular
songs of the minstrels.</p>

<p>II. The inhabitants of Sweden, Denmark, and
Norway, being the latest converts to Christianity,
retained their original manners and opinions longer
than the other nations of Gothic race: and therefore
they have preserved more of the genuine compositions
of their ancient poets, than their southern
neighbours. Hence the progress, among them, from
poetical history to poetical fiction is very discernible:
they have some old pieces, that are in effect complete
Romances of Chivalry<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>. They have also
(as hath been observed) a multitude of Sagas<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> or
histories on romantic subjects, containing a mixture
of prose and verse, of various dates, some of them
written since the times of the Crusades, others long
before: but their narratives in verse only are esteemed
the more ancient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>Now as the irruption of the Normans<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> into
France under Rollo did not take place till towards
the beginning of the tenth century, at which time
the Scaldic art was arrived to the highest perfection
in Rollo's native country, we can easily trace the
descent of the French and English romances of
chivalry from the Northern Sagas. That conqueror
doubtless carried many Scalds with him from the
north, who transmitted their skill to their children
and successors. These adopting the religion, opinions,
and language of the new country, substituted
the heroes of Christendom instead of those of their
pagan ancestors, and began to celebrate the feats of
Charlemagne, Roland, and Oliver; whose true history
they set off and embellished with the Scaldic
figments of dwarfs, giants, dragons, and enchantments.
The first mention we have in song of those
heroes of chivalry is in the mouth of a Norman
warrior at the conquest of England<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>: and this
circumstance alone would sufficiently account for
the propagation of this kind of romantic poems
among the French and English.</p>

<p>But this is not all; it is very certain, that both
the Anglo-Saxons and the Franks had brought with
them, at their first emigrations into Britain and Gaul,
the same fondness for the ancient songs of their ancestors,
which prevailed among the other Gothic
tribes<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>, and that all their first annals were
transmitted in these popular oral poems. This fondness
they even retained long after their conversion to
Christianity, as we learn from the examples of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>Charlemagne and Alfred<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. Now poetry, being
thus the transmitter of facts, would as easily learn
to blend them with fictions in France and England,
as she is known to have done in the north, and that
much sooner, for the reasons before assigned<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>.
This, together with the example and influence of
the Normans, will easily account to us, why the
first romances of chivalry that appeared both in
England and France<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> were composed in metre,
as a rude kind of epic songs. In both kingdoms
tales in verse were usually sung by minstrels to
the harp on festival occasions: and doubtless both
nations derived their relish for this sort of entertainment
from their Teutonic ancestors, without either
of them borrowing it from the other. Among both
people narrative songs on true or fictitious subjects
had evidently obtained from the earliest times. But
the professed romances of chivalry seem to have
been first composed in France, where also they had
their name.</p>

<p>The Latin tongue, as is observed by an ingenious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>writer<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>, ceased to be spoken in France about the
ninth century, and was succeeded by what was called
the Romance tongue, a mixture of the language of
the Franks and bad Latin. As the songs of chivalry
became the most popular compositions in that language,
they were emphatically called Romans or Romants;
though this name was at first given to any
piece of poetry. The romances of chivalry can be
traced as early as the eleventh century<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>. I know
not if the <i>Roman de Brut</i> written in 1155, was such:
but if it was, it was by no means the first poem of
the kind; others more ancient are still extant<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>.
And we have already seen, that, in the preceding
century, when the Normans marched down to the
battle of Hastings, they animated themselves, by
singing (in some popular romance or ballad) the
exploits of Roland and the other heroes of chivalry<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.</p>

<p>So early as this I cannot trace the songs of chivalry
in English. The most ancient I have seen, is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>of Hornechild described below, which seems not
older than the twelfth century. However, as this
rather resembles the Saxon poetry than the French,
it is not certain that the first English romances were
translated from that language<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>. We have seen above,
that a propensity to this kind of fiction prevailed
among all the Gothic nations<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>; and, though after
the Norman Conquest, this country abounded with
French romances, or with translations from the
French, there is good reason to believe, that the
English had original pieces of their own.</p>

<p>The stories of King Arthur and his Round Table,
may be reasonably supposed of the growth of this
island; both the French and the Armoricans probably
had them from Britain<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>. The stories of Guy
and Bevis, with some others, were probably the
invention of English minstrels<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>. On the other
hand, the English procured translations of such
romances as were most current in France; and in
the list given at the conclusion of these remarks,
many are doubtless of French original.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>The first prose books of chivalry that appeared in
our language, were those printed by Caxton<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>; at
least, these are the first I have been able to discover,
and these are all translations from the French.
Whereas romances of this kind had been long current
in metre, and were so generally admired in the
time of Chaucer, that his rhyme of Sir Thopas was
evidently written to ridicule and burlesque them<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>.</p>

<p>He expressly mentions several of them by name
in a stanza, which I have had occasion to quote more
than once in this volume:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Men speken of Romaunces of pris<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Horn-Child, and of Ipotis<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Of Bevis, and Sire Guy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sire Libeux, and Pleindamour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sire Thopas, he bereth the flour<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Of real chevalrie"<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Most, if not all of these are still extant in MS. in
some or other of our libraries, as I shall shew in the
conclusion of this slight essay, where I shall give a
list of such metrical histories and romances as have
fallen under my observation.</p>

<p>As many of these contain a considerable portion
of poetic merit, and throw great light on the manners
and opinions of former times, it were to be wished
that some of the best of them were rescued from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>oblivion. A judicious collection of them accurately
published with proper illustrations, would be an important
accession to our stock of ancient English
literature. Many of them exhibit no mean attempts
at epic poetry, and though full of the exploded fictions
of chivalry, frequently display great descriptive and
inventive powers in the bards, who composed them.
They are at least generally equal to any other poetry
of the same age. They cannot indeed be put in
competition with the nervous productions of so universal
and commanding a genius as Chaucer, but
they have a simplicity that makes them be read with
less interruption, and be more easily understood:
and they are far more spirited and entertaining than
the tedious allegories of Gower, or the dull and
prolix legends of Lydgate. Yet, while so much
stress was laid upon the writings of these last, by
such as treat of English poetry, the old metrical
romances, though far more popular in their time,
were hardly known to exist. But it has happened
unluckily, that the antiquaries, who have revived the
works of our ancient writers, have been for the most
part men void of taste and genius, and therefore have
always fastidiously rejected the old poetical romances,
because founded on fictitious or popular subjects,
while they have been careful to grub up every petty
fragment of the most dull and insipid rhymist, whose
merit it was to deform morality, or obscure true history.
Should the publick encourage the revival of some
of those ancient epic songs of chivalry, they would
frequently see the rich ore of an Ariosto or a Tasso,
though buried it may be among the rubbish and
dross of barbarous times.</p>

<p>Such a publication would answer many important
uses: It would throw new light on the rise and progress
of English poetry, the history of which can be
but imperfectly understood, if these are neglected:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
It would also serve to illustrate innumerable passages
in our ancient classic poets, which without their help
must be for ever obscure. For, not to mention
Chaucer and Spencer, who abound with perpetual
allusions to them, I shall give an instance or two
from Shakespeare, by way of specimen of their use.</p>

<p>In his play of <i>King John</i> our great dramatic poet
alludes to an exploit of Richard I. which the reader
will in vain look for in any true history. Faulconbridge
says to his mother, act i. sc. 1.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against whose furie and unmatched force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awlesse lion could not wage the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor keepe his princely heart from Richard's hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that perforce robs Lions of their hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May easily winne a woman's:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fact here referred to, is to be traced to its
source only in the old romance of <i>Richard Ceur["C&oelig;ur"?] de</i>
<i>Lyon</i><a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>, in which his encounter with a lion makes a
very shining figure. I shall give a large extract from
this poem, as a specimen of the manner of these old
rhapsodists, and to shew that they did not in their
fictions neglect the proper means to produce the
ends, as was afterwards so childishly done in the
prose books of chivalry.</p>

<p>The poet tells us, that Richard, in his return from
the Holy Land, having been discovered in the habit
of "a palmer in Almayne," and apprehended as a
spy, was by the king thrown into prison. Wardrewe,
the king's son, hearing of Richard's great strength,
desires the jailor to let him have a sight of his prisoners.
Richard being the foremost, Wardrewe asks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>him, "if he dare stand a buffet from his hand?" and
that on the morrow he shall return him another.
Richard consents, and receives a blow that staggers
him. On the morrow, having previously waxed his
hands, he waits his antagonist's arrival. Wardrewe
accordingly, proceeds the story, "held forth as a
trewe man," and Richard gave him such a blow on
the cheek, as broke his jawbone, and killed him on
the spot. The king, to revenge the death of his son,
orders, by the advice of one Eldrede, that a lion,
kept purposely from food, shall be turned loose upon
Richard. But the king's daughter having fallen in
love with him, tells him of her father's resolution,
and at his request procures him forty ells of white
silk "kerchers;" and here the description of the
combat begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>What follows is not so well, and therefore I shall
extract no more of this poem.&mdash;For the above feat
the author tells us, the king was deservedly called</p>

<p class="center">"Stronge Rycharde Cure de Lyowne."
</p>

<p>That distich which Shakespeare puts in the mouth
of his madman in <i>K. Lear</i>, act iii. sc. 4.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mice and Rats and such small deere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been Tom's food for seven long yeare,"<br /></span>

<p>has excited the attention of the critics. Instead of
<i>deere</i>, one of them would substitute <i>geer</i>; and another
<i>cheer</i><a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>. But the ancient reading is established by
the old romance of Sir Bevis, which Shakespeare
had doubtless often heard sung to the harp. This
distich is part of a description there given of the
hardships suffered by Bevis, when confined for seven
years in a dungeon:</p>

<p>III. In different parts of this work, the reader
will find various extracts from these old poetical
legends; to which I refer him for farther examples
of their style and metre. To complete this subject,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>it will be proper at least to give one specimen of
their skill in distributing and conducting their fable,
by which it will be seen that nature and common
sense had supplied to these old simple bards the
want of critical art, and taught them some of the
most essential rules of epic poetry.&mdash;I shall select
the romance of <i>Libius Disconius</i><a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>, as being one of
those mentioned by Chaucer, and either shorter or
more intelligible than the others he has quoted.</p>

<p>If an epic poem may be defined,<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> "A fable related
by a poet, to excite admiration, and inspire
virtue, by representing the action of some one hero,
favoured by heaven, who executes a great design, in
spite of all the obstacles that oppose him:" I know
not why we should withold the name of Epic Poem
from the piece which I am about to analyse.</p>

<p>My copy is divided into IX. Parts or Cantos, the
several arguments of which are as follows.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part I.</span></p>

<p>Opens with a short exordium to bespeak attention:
the hero is described; a natural son of Sir Gawain a
celebrated knight of king Arthur's court, who being
brought up in a forest by his mother, is kept ignorant
of his name and descent. He early exhibits marks
of his courage, by killing a knight in single combat,
who encountered him as he was hunting. This inspires
him with a desire of seeking adventures: therefore
cloathing himself in his enemy's armour, he goes
to K. Arthur's court, to request the order of knighthood.
His request granted, he obtains a promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>of having the first adventure assigned him that shall
offer.&mdash;A damsel named Ellen, attended by a dwarf,
comes to implore K. Arthur's assistance, to rescue a
young princess, "the Lady of Sinadone" their mistress,
who is detained from her rights, and confined
in prison. The adventure is claimed by the young
knight Sir Lybius: the king assents; the messengers
are dissatisfied, and object to his youth; but are
forced to acquiesce. And here the first book closes
with a description of the ceremony of equipping him
forth.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part II.</span></p>

<p>Sir Lybius sets out on the adventure: he is derided
by the dwarf and the damsel on account of his youth:
they come to the bridge of Perill, which none can
pass without encountering a knight called William
de la Braunch. Sir Lybius is challenged: they just
with their spears: De la Braunch is dismounted:
the battle is renewed on foot: Sir William's sword
breaks: he yields. Sir Lybius makes him swear to
go and present himself to K. Arthur, as the first-fruits
of his valour. The conquered knight sets out
for K. Arthur's court: is met by three knights, his kinsmen;
who, informed of his disgrace, vow revenge, and
pursue the conqueror. The next day they overtake
him: the eldest of the three attacks Sir Lybius; but
is overthrown to the ground. The two other brothers
assault him: Sir Lybius is wounded; yet cuts off
the second brother's arm: the third yields; Sir
Lybius sends them all to K. Arthur. In the third
evening he is awaked by the dwarf, who has discovered
a fire in the wood.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part III.</span></p>

<p>Sir Lybius arms himself, and leaps on horseback:
he finds two giants roasting a wild boar, who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
a fair lady their captive. Sir Lybius, by favour of
the night, runs one of them through with his spear:
is assaulted by the other: a fierce battle ensues: he
cuts off the giant's arm, and at length his head. The
rescued lady (an Earl's daughter) tells him her
story; and leads him to her father's castle; who
entertains him with a great feast; and presents him
at parting with a suit of armour and a steed. He
sends the giant's head to K. Arthur.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part IV.</span></p>

<p>Sir Lybius, maid Ellen, and the dwarf, renew their
journey: they see a castle stuck round with human
heads; and are informed it belongs to a knight called
Sir Gefferon, who, in honour of his lemman or mistress,
challenges all comers: He that can produce a
fairer lady, is to be rewarded with a milk-white
faulcon, but if overcome, to lose his head. Sir
Lybius spends the night in the adjoining town: In
the morning goes to challenge the faulcon. The
knights exchange their gloves: they agree to just
in the market place: the lady and maid Ellen
are placed aloft in chairs: their dresses: the superior
beauty of Sir Gefferon's mistress described:
the ceremonies previous to the combat. They engage:
the combat described at large: Sir Gefferon
is incurably hurt; and carried home on his shield.
Sir Lybius sends the faulcon to K. Arthur; and
receives back a large present in florins. He stays
40 days to be cured of his wounds, which he spends
in feasting with the neighbouring lords.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part V.</span></p>

<p>Sir Lybius proceeds for Sinadone: in the forest
he meets a knight hunting, called Sir Otes de Lisle:
maid Ellen charmed with a very beautiful dog, begs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Sir Lybius to bestow him upon her: Sir Otes meets
them, and claims his dog: is refused: being unarmed
he rides to his castle, and summons his followers:
they go in quest of Sir Lybius: a battle
ensues: he is still victorious, and forces Sir Otes to
follow the other conquered knights to K. Arthur.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part VI.</span></p>

<p>Sir Lybius comes to a fair city and castle by a
riverside, beset round with pavilions or tents: he is
informed, in the castle is a beautiful lady besieged
by a giant named Maugys, who keeps the bridge,
and will let none pass without doing him homage:
this Lybius refuses: a battle ensues: the giant described:
the several incidents of the battle; which
lasts a whole summer's day; the giant is wounded:
put to flight; slain. The citizens come out in procession
to meet their deliverer: the lady invites him
into her castle: falls in love with him; and seduces
him to her embraces. He forgets the princess of
Sinadone, and stays with this bewitching lady a
twelvemonth. This fair sorceress, like another
Alcina, intoxicates him with all kinds of sensual
pleasure; and detains him from the pursuit of
honour.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part VII.</span></p>

<p>Maid Ellen by chance gets an opportunity of
speaking to him; and upbraids him with his vice
and folly: he is filled with remorse, and escapes
the same evening. At length he arrives at the
city and castle of Sinadone: Is given to understand
that he must challenge the constable of the
castle to single combat, before he can be received
as a guest. They just: the constable is worsted:
Sir Lybius is feasted in the castle: he declares his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
intention of delivering their lady; and inquires the
particulars of her history. "Two necromancers have
built a fine palace by sorcery, and there keep her inchanted,
till she will surrender her duchy to them,
and yield to such base conditions as they would
impose."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part VIII.</span></p>

<p>Early on the morrow Sir Lybius sets out for the
inchanted palace. He alights in the court: enters
the hall: the wonders of which are described in
strong Gothic painting. He sits down at the high
table: on a sudden all the lights are quenched: it
thunders, and lightens; the palace shakes; the walls
fall in pieces about his ears. He is dismayed and
confounded: but presently hears horses neigh, and
is challenged to single combat by the sorcerers.
He gets to his steed: a battle ensues, with various
turns of fortune: he loses his weapon; but gets a
sword from one of the necromancers, and wounds
the other with it: the edge of the sword being
secretly poisoned, the wound proves mortal.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part IX.</span></p>

<p>He goes up to the surviving sorcerer, who is carried
away from him by inchantment: at length he
finds him, and cuts off his head; he returns to the
palace to deliver the lady; but cannot find her: as
he is lamenting, a window opens, through which
enters a horrible serpent with wings and a woman's
face: it coils round his neck and kisses him; then
is suddenly converted into a very beautiful lady.
She tells him she is the Lady of Sinadone, and was
so inchanted, till she might kiss Sir Gawain, or some
one of his blood: that he has dissolved the charm,
and that herself and her dominions may be his re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>ward.
The knight (whose descent is by this means
discovered) joyfully accepts the offer; makes her his
bride, and then sets out with her for King Arthur's
court.</p>

<p>Such is the fable of this ancient piece: which the
reader may observe, is as regular in its conduct, as
any of the finest poems of classical antiquity. If the
execution, particularly as to the diction and sentiments,
were but equal to the plan, it would be a
capital performance; but this is such as might be
expected in rude and ignorant times, and in barbarous
unpolished language.</p>

<p>IV. I shall conclude this prolix account, with a
list of such old metrical romances as are still extant;
beginning with those mentioned by Chaucer.</p>

<p>1. The romance of <i>Horne Childe</i> is preserved in
the British Museum, where it is intitled &thorn;e &#x1D79;este
kyng Horne. See Catalog. Harl. MSS. 2253, p. 70.
The language is almost Saxon, yet from the mention
in it of Sarazens, it appears to have been written
after some of the Crusades. It begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All heo ben bly&thorn;e<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&thorn;at to my son&#541; yly&thorn;e:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A son&#541; ychulle ou sin&#541;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Allof &thorn;e &#541;ode kyn&#541;e,"<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another copy of this poem, but greatly altered,
and somewhat modernized, is preserved in the Advocates
Library at Edinburgh, in a MS. quarto volume
of old English poetry [W. 4. 1.] Num. XXXIV. in
seven leaves or folios<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>, intitled, <i>Horn-child and</i>
<i>Maiden Rinivel</i>, and beginning thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mi leve frende dere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herken and ye may here."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>2. The poem of <i>Ipotis</i> (or <i>Ypotis</i>) is preserved in
the Cotton Library, Calig. A. 2, fo. 77, but is rather
a religious legend, than a romance. Its beginning is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He &thorn;at wyll of wysdome here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herkeneth nowe ye may here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a tale of holy wryte<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seynt Jon the Evangelyste wytnesseth hyt."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>3. The romance of Sir <i>Guy</i> was written before
that of Bevis, being quoted in it<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>. An account of
this old poem is given above, p. <a href="#Page_107">107</a>. To which it
may be added, that the two complete copies in MS.
are preserved at Cambridge, the one in the public
library<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>, the other in that of Caius College, Class
A. 8.&mdash;In Ames's Typog. p. 153, may be seen the
first lines of the printed copy.&mdash;The first MS.
begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sythe the tyme that God was borne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>4. <i>Guy and Colbronde</i>, an old romance in three
parts, is preserved in the Editor's folio MS. (p. <a href="#Page_349">349</a>.)
[printed edition, vol. ii. p. 527.] It is in stanzas of
six lines, the first of which may be seen in vol. ii. p.
175, beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When meate and drinke is great plentye."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the Edinburgh MS. (mentioned above) are two
ancient poems on the subject of <i>Guy of Warwick</i>:
viz. Num. XVIII. containing 26 leaves, and XX.
59 leaves. Both these have unfortunately the
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>ginnings wanting, otherwise they would perhaps be
found to be different copies of one or both the preceding
articles.</p>

<p>5. From the same MS. I can add another article
to this list, viz. the romance of <i>Rembrun</i> son of Sir
Guy; being Num. XXI. in 9 leaves: this is properly
a continuation of the History of <i>Guy</i>: and in Art. 3,
the Hist. of Rembrun follows that of Guy as a necessary
part of it. This Edinburgh romance of Rembrun
begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesu that erst of mighte most<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fader and sone and Holy Ghost."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before I quit the subject of Sir Guy, I must observe,
that if we may believe Dugdale in his <i>Baronage</i>
(vol. i. p. 243, col. 2), the fame of our English
Champion had in the time of Henry IV. travelled as
far as the East, and was no less popular among the
Sarazens, than here in the West among the nations
of Christendom. In that reign a Lord Beauchamp
travelling to Jerusalem was kindly received by a
noble person, the Soldan's Lieutenant, who hearing
he was descended from the famous Guy of Warwick,
"whose story they had in books of their own language,"
invited him to his palace; and royally feasting
him, presented him three precious stones of great
value, besides divers cloaths of silk and gold given to
his servants.</p>

<p>6. The romance of <i>Syr Bevis</i> is described in page
216 of this vol. Two manuscript copies of this poem
are extant at Cambridge, viz., in the public library<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>,
and in that of Caius Coll. Class A. 9. (5.)&mdash;The
first of these begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lordyngs lystenyth grete and smale."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>
<p>There is also a copy of this romance of <i>Sir Bevis</i>
<i>of Hamptoun</i>, in the Edinburgh MS. Numb. XXII.
consisting of twenty-five leaves, and beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lordinges herkneth to mi tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is merier than the nightengale."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The printed copies begin different from both, viz.,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lysten, Lordinges, and hold you styl."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>7. <i>Libeaux</i> (<i>Libeaus</i>, or <i>Lybius</i>) <i>Disconius</i> is preserved
in the Editor's folio MS. (page <a href="#Page_317">317</a>) [pr. ed,
vol. ii. p. 415], where the first stanza is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesus Christ christen kinge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his mother that sweete thinge,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Helpe them at their neede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That will listen to my tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a Knight I will you tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A doughtye man of deede."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An older copy is preserved in the Cotton Library
(Calig. A. 2. fol. 40) but containing such innumerable
variations, that it is apparently a different translation
of some old French original, which will account for
the title of <i>Le Beaux Disconus</i>, or the Fair Unknown.
The first line is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesu Christ our Savyour."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As for <i>Pleindamour</i>, or <i>Blandamoure</i>, no romance
with this title has been discovered; but as the word
<i>Blaundemere</i> occurs in the romance of <i>Libius Disconius</i>,
in the Editor's folio MS. p. <a href="#Page_319">319</a> [pr. ed. vol. ii.
p. 420], he thought the name of <i>Blandamoure</i> (which
was in all the editions of Chaucer he had then seen)
might have some reference to this. But <i>Pleindamour</i>,
the name restored by Mr. Tyrwhitt, is more
remote.</p>

<p>8. <i>Le Morte Arthure</i> is among the Harl. MSS
2252, &sect; 49. This is judged to be a translation from
the French; Mr. Wanley thinks it no older than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
time of Henry VII., but it seems to be quoted in
Syr Bevis, (Sign. K. ij. b.) It begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lordinges, that are lesse and deare."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the library of Bennet Coll. Cambridge, No.
351, is a MS. intitled in the catalogue <i>Acta Arthuris</i>
<i>Metrico Anglicano</i>, but I know not its contents.</p>

<p>9. In the Editor's folio MS. are many songs and
romances about King Arthur and his knights, some
of which are very imperfect, as <i>King Arthur and the</i>
<i>King of Cornwall</i> (page <a href="#Page_24">24</a>) [pr. ed. vol. i. p. 61], in
stanzas of four lines, beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Come here,' my cozen Gawaine so gay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The Turke and Gawain</i> (p. <a href="#Page_38">38</a>) [pr. ed. vol. i. p. 90],
in stanzas of six lines beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Listen lords great and small,"<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but these are so imperfect that I do not make distinct
articles of them. See also in this volume, Book I.
No. I., II., IV., V.</p>

<p>In the same MS. p. <a href="#Page_203">203</a> [pr. ed. vol. ii. p. 58], is the
<i>Greene Knight</i>, in two parts, relating a curious adventure
of Sir Gawain, in stanzas of six lines, beginning
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"List: wen Arthur he was k:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>10. <i>The Carle of Carlisle</i> is another romantic tale
about Sir Gawain, in the same MS. p. 448 [pr. ed.
vol. iii. p. 277], in distichs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Listen: to me a litle stond."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In all these old poems the same set of knights
are always represented with the same manners and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>characters; which seem to have been as well known,
and as distinctly marked among our ancestors, as
Homer's Heroes were among the Greeks: for, as
<i>Ulysses</i> is always represented crafty, <i>Achilles</i> irascible,
and <i>Ajax</i> rough; so <i>Sir Gawain</i> is ever courteous
and gentle, <i>Sir Kay</i> rugged and disobliging,
&amp;c. "<i>Sir Gawain with his olde curtesie</i>" is mentioned
by Chaucer as noted to a proverb, in his
<i>Squire's Tale</i>. <i>Canterb. Tales</i>, vol. ii. p. 104.</p>

<p>11. <i>Syr Launfal</i>, an excellent old romance concerning
another of King Arthur's knights, is preserved
in the Cotton Library, Calig. A 2, f. 33. This is a
translation from the French<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>, made by one <i>Thomas</i>
<i>Chestre</i>, who is supposed to have lived in the reign
of Henry VI. (See Tanner's Biblioth.) It is in
stanzas of six lines, and begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Be douyty Artours dawes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The above was afterwards altered by some minstrel
into the romance of <i>Sir Lambewell</i>, in three
parts, under which title it was more generally known<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>.
This is the Editor's folio MS. p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a> [pr. ed. vol.
i. p. 144], beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Doughty in king Arthures dayes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>12. <i>Eger and Grime</i>, in six parts (in the Editor's
folio MS. p. <a href="#Page_124">124</a>) [pr. ed. vol. i. p. 354], is a well invented
tale of chivalry, scarce inferior to any of Ariosto's.
This which was inadvertently omitted in the
former editions of this list, is in distichs, and begins
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It fell sometimes in the Land of Beame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>13. The romance of <i>Merline</i>, in nine parts (preserved
in the same folio MS. p. <a href="#Page_145">145</a> [pr. ed. vol. i.
p. 422]), gives a curious account of the birth, parentage,
and juvenile adventures of this famous British
Prophet. In this poem the <i>Saxons</i> are called <i>Sarazens</i>;
and the thrusting the rebel angels out of
heaven is attributed to "<i>oure Lady</i>." It is in distichs
and begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He that made with his hand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is an old romance <i>Of Arthour and of Merlin</i>,
in the Edinburgh MS. of old English poems: I
know not whether it has anything in common with
this last mentioned. It is in the volume numbered
xxiii. and extends through fifty-five leaves. The
two first lines are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesu Crist, heven king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Al ous graunt gode ending."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>14. <i>Sir Isenbras</i> (or as it is in the MS. copies, <i>Sir</i>
<i>Isumbras</i>), is quoted in Chaucer's <i>R. of Thopas</i>, v. 6.
Among Mr. Garrick's old plays is a printed copy;
of which an account has been already given in
vol. i. book iii. No. vii. It is preserved in MS.
in the Library of Caius Coll. Camb., Class A. 9 (2),
and also in the Cotton Library, Calig. A. 12 (f. 128).
This is extremely different from the printed copy.
E.g.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God &thorn;at made both er&thorn;e and hevene."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>15. <i>Emar&egrave;</i>, a very curious and ancient romance, is
preserved in the same vol. of the Cotton Library,
f. 69. It is in stanzas of six lines, and begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesu &thorn;at ys kyng in trone."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>16. <i>Chevelere assigne</i>, or The Knight of the Swan,
preserved in the Cotton Library, has been already
described in vol. ii. Appendix, <i>Essay on P. Plowman's</i>
<i>Metre</i>, &amp;c., as hath also</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>17. <i>The Sege of F&#275;r&#772;lam</i> (or Jerusalem), which
seems to have been written after the other, and may
not improperly be classed among the romances; as
may also the following, which is preserved in the
same volume, viz.,</p>

<p>18. <i>Owaine Myles</i> (fol. 90), giving an account of
the wonders of St. Patrick's Purgatory. This is a
translation into verse of the story related in Mat.
Paris's <i>Hist.</i> (sub. Ann. 1153.) It is in distichs beginning
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God &thorn;at ys so full of myght."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the same manuscript are three or four other
narrative poems, which might be reckoned among
the romances, but being rather religious legends, I
shall barely mention them; as <i>Tundale</i>, f. 17; <i>Trentale</i>
<i>Sci Gregorii</i>, f. 84; <i>Jerome</i>, f. 133; <i>Eustache</i>,
f. 136.</p>

<p>19. <i>Octavian imperator</i>, an ancient romance of
chivalry, is in the same vol. of the Cotton Library,
f. 20. Notwithstanding the name, this old poem has
nothing in common with the history of the Roman
Emperors. It is in a very peculiar kind of stanza,
whereof 1, 2, 3, &amp; 5 rhyme together, as do the 4
and 6. It begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ihesu &THORN;at was with spere ystonge."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the public library at Cambridge<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>, is a poem
with the same title, and begins very differently:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lyttyll and mykyll, olde and yonge."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>20. <i>Eglamour of Artas</i> (or <i>Artoys</i>) is preserved
in the same vol. with the foregoing, both in the
Cotton Library and Public Library at Cambridge.
It is also in the Editor's folio MS. p. <a href="#Page_295">295</a> [pr. ed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>vol. ii. p. 341], where it is divided into six parts. A
printed copy in the Bodleian Library, C. 39. Art.
Seld., and also among Mr. Garrick's old plays, K.
vol. x. It is in distichs, and begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ihesu Crist of heven kyng."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>21. <i>Syr Triamore</i> (in stanzas of six lines) is preserved
in MS. in the Editor's volume, p. <a href="#Page_210">210</a> [pr. ed.
vol. ii. p. 80], and in the Public Library at Cambridge
(690, &sect; 29. Vid. Cat. MSS. p. 394.) Two
printed copies are extant in the Bodleian Library,
and among Mr. Garrick's plays in the same volumes
with the last article. Both the editor's MS. and the

<p>In the library of Lincoln Cathedral, K k. 3, 10, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
an old imperfect printed copy, wanting the whole
first sheet A.</p>

<p>24. <i>The Squyr of Lowe degre</i>, is one of those burlesqued
by Chaucer in his Rhyme of Thopas<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>. Mr.

</div></div>

<p>25. <i>Historye of K. Richard Cure [C&oelig;ur] de</i>
<i>Lyon.</i> (Impr. W. de Worde, 1528, 4to.) is preserved
in the Bodleian Library, C. 39, Art. Selden. A fragment
of it is also remaining in the Edinburgh MS.
of old English poems; No. xxxvi. in two leaves. A
large extract from this romance has been given
already above, p. <a href="#Page_356">356</a>. Richard was the peculiar
patron of Chivalry, and favourite of the old minstrels
and troubadours. See Warton's <i>Observ.</i> vol. i. p. 29,
vol. ii. p. 40.</p>

<p>26. Of the following I have only seen No. 27, but
I believe they may all be referred to the class of
romances.</p>

<p>The <i>Knight of Courtesy and the Lady of Faguel</i>
(Bod. Lib. C. 39. Art. Sheld. a printed copy).
This Mr. Warton thinks is the story of Coucy's
Heart, related in Fauchet, and in Howel's Letters.
(v. i. s. 6, L. 20, see Wart. <i>Obs.</i> v. ii. p. 40). The
Editor has seen a very beautiful old ballad on this
subject in French.</p>

<p>27. The four following are all preserved in the
MS. so often referred to in the Public Library at
Cambridge, (690. Appendix to Bp. More's MSS. in
Cat. MSS. tom. ii. p. 394), viz., <i>The Lay of Erle of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span><i>Tholouse</i> (No. 27), of which the Editor hath also a
copy from "Cod. MSS. Mus. Ashmol. Oxon." The
first line of both is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesu Chryste in Trynyte."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>28. <i>Roberd Kynge of Cysyll</i> (or Sicily) shewing
the fall of pride. Of this there is also a copy among
the Harl. MSS. 1703 (3). The Cambridge MS.
begins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Princis that be prowde in prese."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>29. <i>Le bone Florence of Rome</i>, beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As ferre as men ride or gone."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>30. <i>Dioclesian the Emperour</i>, beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sum tyme ther was a noble man."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>31. The two knightly brothers <i>Amys and Amelion</i>
(among the Harl MSS. 2386, &sect;. 42) is an old romance
of chivalry, as is also, I believe, the fragment
of the <i>Lady Belesant, the Duke of Lombardy's fair</i>
<i>daughter</i>, mentioned in the same article. See the
catalog. vol. ii.</p>

<p>32. In the Edinburgh MS. so often referred to
(preserved in the Advocates Library, W. 4. i.) might
probably be found some other articles to add to this
list, as well as other copies of some of the pieces
mentioned in it, for the whole volume contains not
fewer than thirty-seven poems or romances, some of
them very long. But as many of them have lost the
beginnings, which have been cut out for the sake of
the illuminations, and as I have not had an opportunity
of examining the MS. myself, I shall be content
to mention only the articles that follow<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>: viz.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>
<p>An old romance about <i>Rouland</i> (not I believe the
famous Paladine, but a champion named <i>Rouland</i>
<i>Louth</i>; query) being in the volume, No. xxvii. in
five leaves, and wants the beginning.</p>

<p>33. Another romance that seems to be a kind of
continuation of this last, intitled, <i>Otuel a Knight</i>,
(No. xxviii. in eleven leaves and a half). The two
first lines are,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Herkneth both yinge and old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That willen heren of battailes bold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>34. <i>The King of Tars</i> (No. iv. in five leaves and
a half; it is also in the Bodleyan Library, MS. Vernon,
f. 304) beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Herkneth to me bothe eld and ying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Maries love that swete thing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>35. A tale or romance (No. i. two leaves), that
wants both beginning and end. The first lines now
remaining are,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Th Erl him graunted his will y-wis. that the knicht him haden y told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Baronnis that were of mikle pris. befor him thay weren y-cald."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>36. Another mutilated tale or romance (No. iii.
four leaves). The first lines at present are,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To Mr. Steward wil y gon.  and tellen him the sothe of the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reseyved bestow sone anon.  gif you will serve and with hir be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>37. A mutilated tale or romance (No. xi. in thirteen
leaves). The two first lines that occur are,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That riche Dooke his fest gan hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Erls and with Baronns bold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I cannot conclude my account of this curious manuscript,
without acknowledging that I was indebted
to the friendship of the Rev. Dr. Blair, the ingenious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
professor of Belles Lettres, in the University of
Edinburgh, for whatever I learned of its contents,
and for the important additions it enabled me to
make to the foregoing list.</p>

<p>To the preceding articles two ancient metrical romances
in the Scottish dialect may now be added,
which are published in Pinkerton's <i>Scottish Poems</i>,
reprinted "from scarce editions," Lond. 1792, in 3
vols. 8vo. viz.</p>

<p>38. <i>Gawan and Gologras</i>, a metrical romance;
from an edition printed at Edinburgh, 1508, 8vo.
beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the tyme of Arthur, as trew men me tald."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is in stanzas of thirteen lines.</p>

<p>39. <i>Sir Gawan and Sir Galaron of Galloway</i>, a
metrical romance, in the same stanzas as No. 38,
from an ancient MS. beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the tyme of Arthur an aunter<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> betydde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Turnwathelan, as the boke tells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whan he to Carlele was comen, and conqueror kyd," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Both these (which exhibit the union of the old
alliterative metre, with rhyme, &amp;c., and in the termination
of each stanza the short triplets of the
Turnament of Tottenham), are judged to be as old
as the time of our K. Henry VI., being apparently
the production of an old poet, thus mentioned
by Dunbar, in his <i>Lament for the Deth of the</i>
<i>Makkaris</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Clerk of Tranent eik he hes take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made the aventers of Sir Gawane."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will scarce be necessary to remind the reader,
that <i>Turnewathelan</i> is evidently <i>Tearne-Wadling</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>celebrated in the old ballad of the <i>Marriage of Sir</i>
<i>Gawaine</i>. See pp. <a href="#Page_14">14</a> and <a href="#Page_325">325</a> of this volume.</p>

<p>Many new references, and perhaps some additional
articles might be added to the foregoing list from
Mr. Warton's <i>History of English Poetry</i>, 3 vols. 4to.
and from the notes to Mr. Tyrwhitt's improved
edition of <i>Chaucer's Canterbury Tales</i>, &amp;c. in 5 vols.
8vo. which have been published since this Essay, &amp;c.
was first composed; but it will be sufficient once for
all to refer the curious reader to those popular
works.</p>

<p>The reader will also see many interesting particulars
on the subject of these volumes, as well as on
most points of general literature, in Sir John Hawkins's
curious <i>History of Music</i>, &amp;c., in 5 volumes,
4to., as also in Dr. Burney's <i>Hist.</i> &amp;c. in 4 vols. 4to.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_475" id="Footnote_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_475"><span class="label">[475]</span></a> The seeds of chivalry sprung up so naturally out of the
original manners and opinions of the northern nations, that it is
not credible they arose so late as after the establishment of the
Feudal System, much less the Crusades. Nor, again, that the
romances of chivalry were transmitted to other nations, through
the Spaniards, from the Moors and Arabians. Had this been the
case the first French romances of chivalry would have been on
Moorish, or at least Spanish subjects: whereas the most ancient
stories of this kind, whether in prose or verse, whether in Italian,
French, English, &amp;c., are chiefly on the subjects of Charlemagne
and the Paladins, or of our British Arthur and his Knights of the
Round Table, &amp;c., being evidently borrowed from the fabulous
chronicles of the supposed Archbishop Turpin and of Jeffery of
Monmouth. Not but some of the oldest and most popular French
romances are also on Norman subjects, as <i>Richard Sans-peur</i>,
<i>Robert le Diable</i>, &amp;c., whereas I do not recollect so much as one
in which the scene is laid in Spain, much less among the Moors,
or descriptive of Mahometan manners. Even in <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>,
said to have been the first romance printed in Spain, the scene is
laid in Gaul and Britain; and the manners are French: which
plainly shews from what school this species of fabling was learnt
and transmitted to the southern nations of Europe.</p></div>

are obliged to take their first step from the Moorish provinces in
Spain, without one intermediate resting place, to Armorica or
Bretagne, the province in France from them most remote, not
more in situation than in the manners, habits, and language of its
Welsh inhabitants, which are allowed to have been derived from
this island, as must have been their traditions, songs, and fables;
being doubtless all of Celtic original. See p. <a href="#Page_3">3</a> of the <i>Dissertation</i>
<i>on the Origin of Romantic Fiction in Europe</i>, prefixed to Mr. Tho.
Warton's <i>History of English Poetry</i>, vol. i. 1774, 4to. If any pen
could have supported this darling hypothesis of Dr. Warburton
that of this ingenious critic would have effected it. But under the
general term Oriental, he seems to consider the ancient inhabitants
of the north and the south of Asia, as having all the same manners,
traditions, and fables; and because the secluded people of
Arabia took the lead under the religion and empire of Mahomet,
therefore everything must be derived from them to the Northern
Asiatics in the remotest ages, &amp;c. With as much reason under
the word Occidental, we might represent the early traditions and
fables of the north and south of Europe to have been the same;
and that the Gothic mythology of Scandinavia, the Druidic or
Celtic of Gaul and Britain, differed not from the classic of Greece
and Rome.
</p>
<p>
There is not room here for a full examination of the minuter
arguments, or rather slight coincidences, by which our agreeable
dissertator endeavours to maintain and defend this favourite
opinion of Dr. W., who has been himself so completely confuted
by Mr. Tyrwhitt. (See his notes on <i>Love's Labour Lost</i>, &amp;c.)
But some of his positions it will be sufficient to mention: such as
the referring the Gog and Magog, which our old Christian bards
might have had from Scripture, to the <i>Jaguiouge</i> and <i>Magiouge</i> of
the Arabians and Persians, &amp;c. (p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>). That "we may venture
to affirm that this (Geoffrey of Monmouth's) Chronicle, supposed
to contain the ideas of the Welsh bards, entirely consists of Arabian
inventions" (p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>). And that, "as Geoffrey's history is the
grand repository of the acts of Arthur, so a fabulous history
ascribed to Turpin is the groundwork of all the chimerical legends
which have been related concerning the conquests of Charlemagne
and his twelve peers. Its subject is the expulsion of the Saracens
from Spain, and it is filled with fictions evidently congenial to
those which characterize Geoffrey's History" (p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>). That is, as
he afterwards expresses it, "lavishly decorated by the Arabian
fablers" (p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>). We should hardly have expected that the Arabian
fablers would have been lavish in decorating a history of their
enemy: but what is singular, as an instance and proof of this
Arabian origin of the fictions of Turpin, a passage is quoted from
his fourth chapter, which I shall beg leave to offer, as affording
decisive evidence, that they could not possibly be derived from a
Mahometan source. Sc. "The Christians under Charlemagne are
said to have found in Spain a golden idol, or image of Mahomet,
as high as a bird can fly&mdash;it was framed by Mahomet himself of
the purest metal, who, by his knowledge in necromancy, had
sealed up within it a legion of diabolical spirits. It held in its
hand a prodigious club; and the Saracens had a prophetic tradition,
that this club should fall from the hand of the image in that
year when a certain king should be born in France, &amp;c." (<i>vid.</i>
p. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>, note.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_481" id="Footnote_481"></a><a href="#FNanchor_481"><span class="label">[481]</span></a> The little narrative songs on Morisco subjects, which the
Spaniards have at present in great abundance, and which they call
peculiarly <i>romances</i>, (see vol. i. book iii. no. xvi. &amp;c.), have nothing
in common with their proper romances (or histories) of chivalry,
which they call <i>Historias de Cavallerias</i>; these are evidently imitations
of the French, and shew a great ignorance of Moorish
manners: and with regard to the Morisco, or song <i>romances</i>, they
do not seem of very great antiquity; few of them appear, from
their subjects, much earlier than the reduction of Granada, in the
fifteenth century: from which period, I believe, may be plainly
traced among the Spanish writers, a more perfect knowledge of
Moorish customs, &amp;c.</p></div>

Lancelot du Lac, Tristan, &amp;c., were among the first that appeared
in the French language in prose, yet these were originally composed
in metre: the editor has in his possession a very old French
MS. in verse, containing <i>L'ancien Roman de Perceval</i>, and metrical
copies of the others may be found in the libraries of the curious.

<p><a name="Footnote_501" id="Footnote_501"></a><a href="#FNanchor_501"><span class="label">[501]</span></a> The first romances of chivalry among the Germans were in
metre: they have some very ancient narrative songs (which they
call <i>Lieder</i>) not only on the fabulous heroes of their own country,
but also on those of France and Britain, as Tristram, Arthur,
Gawain, and the knights <i>von der Tafel-ronde</i> (<i>vid.</i> Goldasti Not. in
<i>Eginhart. Vit. Car. Mag.</i> 4to. 1711, p. 207.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_502" id="Footnote_502"></a><a href="#FNanchor_502"><span class="label">[502]</span></a> The Welsh have still some very old romances about K.
Arthur; but as these are in prose, they are not probably their first
pieces that were composed on that subject.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_503" id="Footnote_503"></a><a href="#FNanchor_503"><span class="label">[503]</span></a> It is most credible that these stories were originally of
English invention, even if the only pieces now extant should be
found to be translations from the French. What now pass for the
French originals were probably only amplifications, or enlargements
of the old English story. That the French romances borrowed
some things from the English, appears from the word
<i>termagant</i>.</p></div>

&amp;c. As the old minstrelsy wore out, prose books of chivalry
became more admired, especially after the Spanish romances began
to be translated into English towards the end of Q. Elizabeth's
reign: then the most popular metrical romances began to be
reduced into prose, as <i>Sir Guy</i>, <i>Bevis</i>, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>[In several of the poems Percy
used the letter z to represent the
Anglo-Saxon character &#541;, but as
this is incorrect, and, moreover,
gives rise to a very frequent mispronunciation,
the z has been
replaced by y in this edition,
and several words have therefore
